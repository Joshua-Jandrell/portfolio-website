                one do other than revel in the 'metaness' (on afflation to
                Facebook) of the whole situation. Here I am writing a blog about

                to think this is how Bush imagined it, one article linking to
                the next allowing thoughts to organically grow. It is fitting
                that we continue to build on Bush's idea - appending our
                thoughts to his great trail: one of many strands in a giant,

                technology progressing after the world war II, and how he feels
                it <em>should</em> progress. Bush predicts that Humanities'
                ability to accurately construct more complex mechanisms is bound
                to increase. This new-found power should be used to store all
                humanities knowledge in a more accessible manner. Bush goes on
                to propose a revolutionary concept:

                obsolete) but, its most profound feature is not how information
                is stored; rather how it is accessed. The Memex will not use a
                rigid index, for this is an abstract and arbitrary structure,
                incompatible with the human perception of ideas! Instead
                articles within the Memex will be linked to together in trials -

                thoughts of Bush are poignant. Many pioneers in the field of

                sight 'As We May Think' as their inspiration. Although, while
                profoundly influential, Harper feels Bush's true vison remains
                unfulfilled. He notes that Bush remained devoted to the physical
                world and tangible experience. Bush spent his time constricting
                a complex mechanical integrator - refusing to embrace the
                abstract seeds of digital computation which were simultaneously
                being sown at
                <a
                  class="inline-link"
                  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology"
                  target="_blank"
                  >his own institution</a
                >. In a similar manner, Bush rejected the concept of abstract
                data/information hierarchies: he believed that information
                should be stored as associations within the human mind. Harper
                goes on to explain how Bush believed that, "the computer should
                adapt itself to accommodate human needs; not the reverse." In
                fact, Bush extended this notion to science itself. The key
                concept of "As We May Think" was not the fanciful designs of
                complex mechanism but rather the passionate belief that
                technology could be used to enhance the human experience and
                augment thought itself. This is the philosophy of the innovator
                and the inventor - a philosophy to which Harper (a man whose
                research focusses on enhancing the accessibility of technology)
                undoubtedly subscribes. Harper feels that the ideas of Bush have
                not demised over timer or chancing technology - the needs of the
                humanity remain.

                Much has changed since the time of Bush, and even since the time
                of Harper. Technologies rapid advancement has left once new
                terms like "web 2.0" sounding as ancient as "micofilm". The
                internet is more massive and more important to human life than
                Bush could ever have imagined. The world wide web has become far
                more than just a repository of knowledge, it hosts a far broader
                spectrum of humanity as a whole. Humans after all are social
                beings - so it is natural that much of the internet is devoted
                to socialization, entertainment an recreation. In this age data
                is at our finger tips, so easily accessed it has become mundane.
                Yet the echoes of Memex and Bush's vison still live on.

                Before we continue I must confess that I am a mere flee;
                crawling across the shoulders of giants. I am so small in
                comparison that these shoulders are not lofty height to me; but
                rather a flat plain. A new 'ground' upon which to build. I know
                precious little about the birth of the internet and even less
                about the technology of the time before. You see I grew up with
                the internet: from playful childhood wonder of long-lost with

              <h2 class="main-h">And what may I think?</h2>
              <p>
                Given my experiences, when I first read 'As We May Think' I was
                inclined to cast it aside as the stale vison of a man who had
                failed to move with the times. A doubtlessly great thinker,
                perceiving the future's vague shapes on the horizon; unable to
                see their true from through the mist of time. Bush's concept of
                an automated shop seems quaint in a world of
                <a

                making some predictions but failing to capture the full picture
                of societies progress.&nbsp; After all, Bush was fixated on the
                tangible and the physical when the world moved to the digital
                and the abstract. He had achieved true mastery of his mechanical
                realm but was afraid to move on to the next. In this new digital
                world he too would be a feel. Perhaps Harper intended to make
                similar criticisms when he mentioned the

                There is no shortage of software capable of solving integral
                equations: I seldom marvel at this feat. In the abstract world
                of software, mathematical computation capacity is expected.
                After all, <em>computers are built on </em><i>Math</i>. Yet I
                cannot begin to imagine how such a system could exist
                mechanically. The only from of analogue integration I can
                imagine is the
                <a

                  >op-amp integrator circuit</a
                >. Still a piece of abstract electronic circuitry; overshadowed
                by Bush's physical device. I have begun to realize that Bush was
                a master of a long forgotten art. My psyche has been so shaped
                by technology that I've lost part of my connection to the
                physical. So much so that I could not conceive the machine Bush
                created.
              </p>
              <p>
                Nor could I conceive the Memex, at least not in it's true form.
                (However, I doubt Bush could imagine memes so we are even!)
                While I may still scoff at the idea of microfilm, I am taken
                aback by the idea of indexing information by thought patterns of
                the human mind. This notion seemed chaotic and unreasonable to
                me - both in use and technical implementation. Even though my
                own chaotic ramblings here (fool of tangents and interjections)
                prove Bush's assertions about the human mind. I am so
                conditioned by the world of abstract technology that I have
                learnt to adapt to its capabilities. I have learnt to see the
                rigid and indexed form of the internet as a superior storage
                method (although search engines do make its navigation far
                simpler than that bush imagined).

                I am a mere flee, navigating an ever-changing plain, adapting my
                path based on its obstacles.

              <p>
                In mamy respects Harper was correct to state the Bush's vision
                had not fully been realized. In fact in some respect the Memex
                was superior to the comparators of today. It could be operated
                entirely by speech - or perhaps even by thought, connecting
                directly to the brain. Such functionality would resolve the
                accessibility issues with the modern web which Harper is trying
                to address. Although in my mind Harpers comments cut far deeper
                than the form of technology, they address its function.
              </p>
              <p>
                Bush's mechanical from of pistons and microfilm is long gone -
                ironically outlived by books. Yet his faith in science is more
                profound than ever. Bush and Harper's belief that technology
                should benefit humanity is not the whim of na&iuml;ve inventors:
                it is a mission that should be followed by all. I have spent my
                life imagining what technology could do, and how it capabilities
                could impact humanity. As a future designers (and human general)
                it is my duty to focus on what technology should do and how
                humanities needs can shape it.
              </p>
              <p>
                Bush was was not looking at the horizon: he was looking beyond
                it. He did not fail to predict the future; it failed to meet his
                vison.
              </p>

            <section id="what_may_i_do">
              <h2 class="main-h">What May I Do?</h2>
              <p>
                I cannot afford to be a flee crawling on the shoulders of
                giants. It is my duty to stand up and be a human, to survey the
                vast world below, to look beyond the horizon and to forge a new
                path.
              </p>
              <p>
                Of course I must also be wary, like Bush one is likely only to
                imagine a fragment of what is to come. The functions and
                concepts of the Memex have more similarities with
                <a
                  class="inline-link"
                  href="https://jam.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipidia"
                  target="_blank"
                  >Wikipedia</a
                >
                - an online encyclopedia (which I have been 'subtly' linking) -
                than the internet as a whole. Wikipedia form an online
                repository of free information. It allows users to edit articles
                and add links to related articles - these links follow any
                reasonable connection within the author's mind. Bush alone did
                not have dreams which could be realized by the world wide wed
                instead it is a collective, ever changing effort of humanities
                whole.
              </p>
              <p>
                The key message of Harpers essay was not the longevity of Bush's
                Memex but rather the immortality of his vision to tailor
                technology for humanities good. Of course 'good' is a
                perspective. Yet, any design intended to benefit humanity is
                likely to hold value 22; 65 or even 77 year late. Even if its
                function has taken a very different from.
              </p>
              <p>
                I will end with a quote of Harper quoting Bush, "Bush is quoted
                as saying that, &lsquo;Science has a simple faith, which
                transcends utility. It is the<br />faith that it is the
                privilege of man to learn to understand, and that this is his
                mission.&rsquo; Personal associations derived from experience,
                and not abstract structures, enables us to learn<br />better and
                understand better, in this way Bush&rsquo;s faith in science and
                humanities mission<br />can be better accomplished."
