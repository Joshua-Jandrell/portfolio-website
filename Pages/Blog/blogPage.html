              Sematic markup is one of the first buzz words to be thrown around

              elements useful tags which appropriately describe their function

                Okay&hellip; So what does it mean to be semantic?
              </h2>
              <p>
                According to the Collins dictionary: (sɪm&aelig;ntɪk) ADJECTIVE
                [usually ADJECTIVE noun] Semantic is used to describe things
                that deal with the meanings of words and sentences.&rdquo; In
                short, semantics means meaning. Although, sematic meaning
                (although tautology) speaks specifically to the distinct and
                specific meaning of a symbol. (&hellip;or a word &ndash; but if
                you ask me worlds are linguistic symbols. I&rsquo;ll just use
                symbol from now on.) What exactly does this symbol communicate?
                How does its meaning differ from similar symbols? Does a symbol
                have multiple meanings? &nbsp;What are the implications and
                connotations of using this symbol? How could it be interpreted?
                It is the difference between brisk and fast, or = and &asymp;.
                Furthermore, these 2(meanings) are &sum; &times; &int; puns
                puns. (Have fun with that one).

            <section id="what_is_markup">
              <h2 class="main-h">And what is markup?</h2>
              <p>
                According to the Economic times &ldquo;Markup refers to the
                value that a player adds to the cost price of a product.&rdquo;
                And so sematic markup would be the value markup adds to &ndash;
                hang on! We have a sematic issue here! My silly old web browser
                doesn&rsquo;t understand language in the way that you or I do.
                The symbol &lsquo;markup&rsquo; has different meanings in
                different contexts. How the heck is it meant to know which one I
                want?
              </p>
              <p>
                Okay, after a more semantic search, Encyclopaedia Britannica
                told me that a markup<strong> language</strong>, is &ldquo;a
                standard text-encoding system consisting of a set of symbols
                inserted in a text document to control its structure,
                formatting, or the relationship between its parts.&rdquo; An
                example of this is HTML (Hypertext markup language) which has
                been used to organise the structure of the page you are on right
                now. Markup refers to the tags and labels used to tell your
                browser every bit of text is. Is it a heading? Is it a link to
                another web page? Is it this article you are reding now?
              </p>
            </section>
            <section id="why_should_i_care">
              <h2 class="main-h">But I still don't care. Why should I?</h2>
              <p>
                Let&rsquo;s Imagine I want to organise all my belongings into
                different labelled boxes. I could label the boxes
                &ldquo;things&rdquo; and &ldquo;stuff&rdquo;. These labels are
                technically correct, and the boxes will function as boxes, they
                might even look quite nifty. But you&rsquo;d have no clue where
                to look if you wanted to find my bright green highlighter. Is it
                a &lsquo;thing&rsquo; or a &lsquo;stuff&rsquo;? Now imagine if
                you were my silly search engine. You don&rsquo;t know the
                difference between markup and markup, you have no clue what
                highlighter is. You can&rsquo;t even see green, let alone speak
                English. This highlights (sorry, not sorry) the issues with
                un-sematic markup. Html tags like &lt;div&gt; and &lt;span&gt;
                mean little more than &lsquo;things&rsquo; and
                &lsquo;stuff&rsquo;.
              </p>
              <p>
                Combining the definitions above tells us that semantic markup
                means <em>Meaningful labelling</em>. It is about accurately and
                effectively communicating the structure, formatting, and
                relationship between parts of a document (like this web page).
                Fancy styles and formatting alone only imply meaning on your
                screen, but not to a machine. &nbsp;It is much like me expecting
                you to find my highlighter in the green box of stuff with my
                pencil case sticking out &ndash; you&rsquo;d have known if you
                could see it. Good markup will make a document more analysable
                and readable to a computerized visitor. The computer needs to
                see labels it understands. A box labelled
                &ldquo;stationary&rdquo; may be quite useful, and a bag labelled
                highlighters within that box would help too. This will improve
                the searchability of a web page. Furthermore, it will allow
                screen readers to give a better description of the webpage,
                enhancing accessibility and understanding. It&rsquo;s just good
                practice to keep your &lsquo;stuff&rsquo; well organised.
                Especially if you have all kinds of visitors and you expect them
                all to find things.
              </p>
              <p>
                It is all to easy to see the internet as a visual medium. But if
                a pictures says a thousand words then sematic markup should say
                them too. That way everyone (human or computer) is on the same
                [web]page.
