            <h2 class="main-h">What's a metaphor?</h2>
            <p>
              Ah, that's easy: a metaphor is a direct comparison. Metaphors are
              the strongest form of comparison - suggesting that the the
              concepts compared are not just similar but in fact equivalent to
              one another. Naturally this greatly highlights similarities
              between the compared ideas - simultaneously masking and
              down-playing the differences. Of course, as figurative langue
              metaphors are not literal: they can be vague or specific, vague or
              contextual. Two objects need not to be exactly (or even remotely)
              alike when compared via a metaphor. Metaphors often transfer
              connotations and denotations. Calling King Henry a lion suggests
              that he was a strong and brave leader rather than evoking any
              clear similarities between them an a predatory cat. I'm waffling
              on a bit but the point I wanted to make is that metaphors hold
              great deal of descriptive power and can be used to evoke a wide
              array of associations and connotations.
            </p>
            <p>
              One more thing: metaphorical comparisons do not need to be
              explicitly stated, they can be implied. For example, if I were to
              tell you that I was "battening to meet deadlines" I would be
              implying a metaphor between the work I need to do and a violent
              and stressful conflict (all connotations and conditions apply).
              This sort of metaphorical language is particular prevalent in the
              the abstract digital context where metaphors are often implied or
              extended buy the way information is described, the manner in which
              tasks are conducted and even the names given to data structures
              and other artifacts.

          <section id="why_so_many_digital">
            <h2 class="main-h">But why so many digital metaphors?</h2>
            <p>
              How else would you describe an abstract world? At its core,
              digital information is pure data - nothing more than 1's and 0's.
              This raw data is formless, tasteless and [description missing]. It
              is hard for us humans to visualize or comprehend. We are better at
              recognizing patterns, making connections between ideas and
              applying prior knowledge to new satiations. Metaphors let us play
              to our strengths: explaining abstract and complex concepts in more
              familiar and finite terms.
            </p>
            <p>
              A good example of this is abstract data types (Stacks, queues,
              heaps, tress, graphs etc.). Each 'type' is a means of organizing
              digital information in a manner that is intuitive for humans. The
              names of there types are effetely metaphors. For example let me
              tell you about the thingymabob. The first piece of data that goes
              into a thingymabob is the last piece of data that come out of it.
              This concept is not necessarily easy to understand or remember.
              But what if I told you that the thingymabob is a 'stack' of data.
              Now you have an intuitive mental understanding of what's going on.
              The first item in is the one on the bottom - the most recently
              added one is on the top. Obviously the top most item is the one
              that will be the simplest to remove. This analogy defines how the
              data is sored and manipulated and allows humans to think about the
              ADT in a taggable manner.
            </p>
            <p>
              The term 'web' plays a similar role. This time describing how data
              is connected. Vannevar Bush [1] goes to great length to explain
              the vast and versatile links between information in his
              hypertext-inducing Memex. Bush eventually refers to this multitude
              of paths as a web of information. This metaphor is apt: describing
              threads of thoughts spanning between numerous points. Spider webs
              are organic and do not have a strict regimented structure (however
              they are still constructed with some logic and purpose). Bush
              hoped that the memex would give humans the same 'organic freedom'
              to flexibly position strands between ideas without the harsh rules
              of computerized indexing. The notion of the world wide web is a
              similar concept but on a global scale. Although not quit what bush
              imagined the internet (a net is just a man-made web with
              structure) is alive and well and crawling with spider-bots.
            </p>
            <p>
              Other metaphors highlight different aspects of the web. For
              example the notion of webpages invokes the idea of a digital
              library. This makes sense: the internet is filled with articles
              and information - so is a library of books or an archive of
              information. You are reading on this webpage right now after all.
              This also invites the notion of digital informing storage.
              Although perhaps this description fails to capture the intricate
              and varied traversal created by the interwoven stands of hypertext
              searching for an article can be seen as looking though a library.
            </p>
            <p>
              Perhaps this notion of navigating a physical space is better for
              describing internet traversal. Once you know a friends street
              address you can visit. Once you know the address of a website we
              can travel there. Most websites take you to a 'home' page which
              forms a landmark for further internet exploration. Think of 'web
              traffic' or 'visitors' to a site. This metaphor portrays the web
              as a public space and acknowledges that users can easily move from
              one point to another. It also makes abstract and unpredictable
              hypertext feel more approachable. hyperlinks are routs between
              different destinations Simon Shum [2] notes that understanding
              hypertext through the metaphor of a digital space can allow users
              to gain a better cognitive map of its structure. Moving from one
              site to another simplifies the user's understanding while
              providing a valuable means to unpack the users experience. Shum
              notes that much like physical spaces, digital spaces can have
              qualities, connotations and associations. Isn't this a great
              analogy! (It has it's moments, but digital spaces are
              non-Euclidian which is a bit of a bummer.) In fact the previous
              two were great analogies too! We have simplified the web with a
              metaphor and now we understand it!
            </p>
            <p>
              I would be very surprised if anyone could describe the world wide
              web without using one of them (they couldn't even say the name).
              The three metaphors mentioned are just the tip of the iceberg.
              Imagine trying to describe any digital structure without using any
              metaphors at all. What is the initial landing space on your
              computer if not a desktop? (Don't be cleaver and say shell, that's
              just a metaphor for a machine's external layer.) What is a folder?
              What is this 'thing' you are on right now if not a site or a page.
            </p>

              Hang on a moment - You've lost your marbles. You just naming
              things! These aren't metaphors
            </p>
            <p>
              Aren't they? Sure they are what we call 'digital stuff' but these
              'names' represent physical objects. That's no coincidence. It
              would be almost impossible to understand the abstract concepts
              they represent without the more taggable affordances of their
              namesake items. And that is the problem!

            <p>
              Our understanding of digital information is so defined by
              metaphorical mapping that our metaphors begin to define how we
              understand digital information. Entries in the stack ADT are not
              actually piled on top of each other - we just imagine that they
              are - data in the stack could be strewn all over physical memory.
              Similarly, you don't visit a website - it visits you. Your browser
              retrieves a document from a server and displays it on your screen
              (that library metaphor wasn't half bad). >
            </p>
            <p>
              A metaphor is figurative langue. In a poetic device. It doesn't
              need to be accurate. It just needs to convey the intended message.
              Think about surfing the web - this metaphor was coined by Jean
              Armour Polly with the intent of making web browsing sound fun and
              adventurous [3]. Using the internet has as much to do with a
              costal watersport as a King Henry with a carnivorous feline. >
            </p>
            <p class="retoric" aria-roledescription="retoric">
              Whatever. If it makes sense, who cases what metaphors mean?
            </p>
            <p>
              With metaphors defining the affordances we give digital
              information - their connotations are vital. Think of the cloud. A
              mysterious ethereal realm where one can backup all your data
              (saving it for a rainy day). On the surface this makes sense. the
              cloud is an ever present repository of information. It is as if
              your files exist in the atmosphere. In realty 'the cloud' is just
              a big old server. Like any computer it has limited space and high
              energy requirements, two feature that tend to be overcast by the
              cloud paradigm.
            </p>
            <p>
              Digital metaphors are often political and push certain agendas
              either intentionally or by accident. Maria Lindh [4] observes how
              metaphors obscure the sociopolitical implications of digital
              mediums. When an archive server become a cloud it feels like a
              natural, almost mystical, phenomenon. Those using 'the cloud'
              become unaware of the technical infrastructure supporting its
              functionality or the true potential and implications of the
              assonated technology. In 'Metaphors in critical Internet and
              digital media studies' Sally Wayatt [5] adds that such metaphors
              can define how a digital artifact is used and designed. Terms like
              data mining and big data as new gold/oil present data as a natural
              resource which should be extracted for fanatical gain. This
              uncountably changes the way big data is used, collected an managed
              with a focus on maximizing profit.

              Validating an NFT is a good technical description but it sound
              like a boring administrative process. Minting in the block-chain,
              on the other hand, evokes a comparison between NFTs and currency.
              And thus it is implied that NFTs must have some sort of inherent
              monetary value. Could this me a factor in the huge value assigned
              to NFTs by society?

              No&hellip; okay maybe a little but I have a point. Seeing
              metaphors as mutual exclusive defections for digital artifacts
              obfuscates the true nature of the artifact. In 'The medium is the
              message' Marshall McLuhan mentions the far-reaching implantation
              of electric light as a medium of pure information. How much harder
              would such an observation have been if the lightbulb had been seen
              as a 'glass candle'. This highlights the similarities in function
              but fails to address (or even acknowledge) the impact of
              electrical power. Many of digital metaphors are glass candles:

            <ul>
              <li>
                The web-paradigm describes a structure of linked information (or
                devices) but does little to unpack what that information does.
                Webs are static while data changes and flows.
              </li>
              <li>
                The library metaphor describes archived information but ignores
                the progression of the medium.
              </li>
              <li>
                The digital space analogy is like the stake ADT, relying on
                conventional understanding and implied use rather than technical
                structure or functionality.

              <li>
                The cloud-backup metaphor describes the utility of a digital
                while trying to pretend that it isn't a digital archive.
              </li>
              <li>
                Data mining metaphors emphasize the importance of information
                whole commodifying personal data.

                Minting in the block chain describes authentication while

              Ah I get it now. All these metaphors are bad right?
            </h2>
            <p>
              No Digital Metaphors are great <em>because</em> they define how we
              understand, view and use information.
            </p>
            <p>
              A metaphor is a painting. It depicts its subject more succinctly
              than words could ever describe. It's powerfully descriptive: alive
              more emotion feeling than any honest photograph. There is nothing
              wrong with art. As long as we are aware that a painting is not
              realty.
            </p>
            <p>
              Digital metaphors are artist tools for unpacking abstract
              information. They give an intuitive vision of what happening. But
              they are inaccurate and limited. Using these metaphors is to be
              encoring because it allows us to visualize what's going on.
              However, all these tool have limitation and should serve to
              augment understanding rather than replace it.
            </p>
            <p>
              It is wonderful that there is a variety of digital metaphors. This
              gives us a more diverse set of lenses to view technology through.
              Each metaphor depicts the concept from a different angle and gives
              alternative insights. If anything, we should be upset that there
              aren't more digital metaphors. Who cares if our metaphors are
              mixed - they are not pieces of a puzzle,but fragments of a
              collage.

                  <h3 class="main-h">Sematic markup: What is it? Who cares?</h3>
                  Sematic markup is one of the first buzz words to be thrown
                  around when it comes to well-written html. It is the idea of
                  giving elements useful tags which appropriately describe their
                  function and meaning. Simplistically, it is the difference
                  between storing this article in an
                  <code>&lt;article&gt;</code> element as opposed to a
                  <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>. This may have not impact on the
                  visual styling of this page when viewed on your computer
                  screen but it has a profound impact on how things are viewed
                  by your computer. Good semantics allow computers, web crawlers
                  and screen readers to get a better understanding of the
                  intended function of each line of text.
