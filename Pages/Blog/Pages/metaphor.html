      content=" So you're surfing the web and land on my site. You browse around
    before navigating to the blog page. Then you follow the link that
    takes you to this post. Or maybe this addressed popped up in your
    search results because a crawler picked this article for you.
    Either way you're here - so welcome. At this point in time you are
    either nodding in agreement or scratching your head in confusion -
    what exactly is going on? Shakespeare would probably rip his hair
    out over all the mixed-metaphors and conflicting imagery. Read the
    first paragraph again while imaging it outside of its digital
    digital context. What the heck is going on? Are you surfing a
    wave; crawling across a spider-web; navigating to a street
    address; or paging though a book? May be you are doing all of the
    above, or non of the above&hellip; It's no secret that we use
    copious amounts of metaphors when referring to the digital realm.
    But why do we use them? How do we choose them? What do they tell
    us? What don't they tell us? And, why is it worth keeping such a
    mess of confounding analogies."
