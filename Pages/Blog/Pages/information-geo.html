      content="'Towards a study of information geographies: (im)mutable
      augmentations and a mapping of the geographies of information' by
      Graham, De Sabatta and Zook highlights the equality of geographic access,
      representation and participation within the global space. The inescapably
      space and time bound nature of the internet is discusses. The power of
      immutable mobiles and the political influence of hegemonic modes is
      highlighted. Graham et al not the controlling information leads to control
      of a narrative and thus to political power. In this framework being unable
      to participate in, contribute to or be represented by information leads to
      politically disempowerment. The article then produces statistics which
      indicate the disproportionate internet access, participation and
      representation of the global North when compared to the global South. It
      is not the intention of the paper to explain the data in any great detail.
      The information is used to highlight that the universally of the internet
      is a myth. The paper concludes that the digital era has failed in
      overcoming geographic inequalities of the past. In face, in some cases.
      these inequalities have been exacerbated by the internet. Although the
      context of the data can be interrogated, the general trend is undeniable.
      But, what is the cause of these disparities and are they as far-reaching
      as Graham et al imply?"
