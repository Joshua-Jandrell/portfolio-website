      content="It's been a while since I did any high level design work on my website.
      It's time to dive back I and take a critical look the user interface (UI)
      and the user experience (UX) of the website. What is good, what is bad and
      what can I do to fix it? Delivering a good UX is critical to making a good
      site. Well sort of. The user experience is a confluence between the
      experiential and emotional affects of interacting with an artifact as well
      the context where in this interaction takes place [1]. The experience that
      a user has while using an artifact has a clear impact on their engagement
      engage with it and how they evaluate it's quality after using it [1][2].
      Delivering the desired experience will result in the website evoking the
      intended response. UX is especially important for a portfolio website like
      mine because, let's face it, you have no real reason to be here. There is
      not task you need to accomplish."
