      Sematic markup is one of the first buzz words to be thrown around when it
      comes to well-written html. It is the idea of giving elements useful tags
      which appropriately describe their function and meaning. Simplistically,
      it is the difference between storing this article in an
      <code>&lt;article&gt;</code> element as opposed to a
      <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>. This may have not impact on the visual styling
      of this page when viewed on your computer screen but it has a profound
      impact on how things are viewed by your computer. Good semantics allow
      computers, web crawlers and screen readers to get a better understanding
      of the intended function of each line of text.</article

        <h2 class="main-h">
          Okay&hellip; So what does it mean to be semantic?
        </h2>
        <p>
          According to the Collins dictionary: (sɪm&aelig;ntɪk) ADJECTIVE
          [usually ADJECTIVE noun] Semantic is used to describe things that deal
          with the meanings of words and sentences.&rdquo; In short, semantics
          means meaning. Although, sematic meaning (although tautology) speaks
          specifically to the distinct and specific meaning of a symbol.
          (&hellip;or a word &ndash; but if you ask me worlds are linguistic
          symbols. I&rsquo;ll just use symbol from now on.) What exactly does
          this symbol communicate? How does its meaning differ from similar
          symbols? Does a symbol have multiple meanings? &nbsp;What are the
          implications and connotations of using this symbol? How could it be
          interpreted? It is the difference between brisk and fast, or = and
          &asymp;. Furthermore, these 2(meanings) are &sum; &times; &int; puns
          puns. (Have fun with that one).

      <section id="what_is_markup">
        <h2 class="main-h">And what is markup?</h2>
        <p>
          According to the Economic times &ldquo;Markup refers to the value that
          a player adds to the cost price of a product.&rdquo; And so sematic
          markup would be the value markup adds to &ndash; hang on! We have a
          sematic issue here! My silly old web browser doesn&rsquo;t understand
          language in the way that you or I do. The symbol &lsquo;markup&rsquo;
          has different meanings in different contexts. How the heck is it meant
          to know which one I want?
        </p>
        <p>
          Okay, after a more semantic search, Encyclopaedia Britannica told me
          that a markup<strong> language</strong>, is &ldquo;a standard
          text-encoding system consisting of a set of symbols inserted in a text
          document to control its structure, formatting, or the relationship
          between its parts.&rdquo; An example of this is HTML (Hypertext markup
          language) which has been used to organise the structure of the page
          you are on right now. Markup refers to the tags and labels used to
          tell your browser every bit of text is. Is it a heading? Is it a link
          to another web page? Is it this article you are reding now?
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="why_should_i_care">
        <h2 class="main-h">But I still don't care. Why should I?</h2>
        <p>
          Let&rsquo;s Imagine I want to organise all my belongings into
          different labelled boxes. I could label the boxes &ldquo;things&rdquo;
          and &ldquo;stuff&rdquo;. These labels are technically correct, and the
          boxes will function as boxes, they might even look quite nifty. But
          you&rsquo;d have no clue where to look if you wanted to find my bright
          green highlighter. Is it a &lsquo;thing&rsquo; or a
          &lsquo;stuff&rsquo;? Now imagine if you were my silly search engine.
          You don&rsquo;t know the difference between markup and markup, you
          have no clue what highlighter is. You can&rsquo;t even see green, let
          alone speak English. This highlights (sorry, not sorry) the issues
          with un-sematic markup. Html tags like &lt;div&gt; and &lt;span&gt;
          mean little more than &lsquo;things&rsquo; and &lsquo;stuff&rsquo;.
        </p>
        <p>
          Combining the definitions above tells us that semantic markup means
          <em>Meaningful labelling</em>. It is about accurately and effectively
          communicating the structure, formatting, and relationship between
          parts of a document (like this web page). Fancy styles and formatting
          alone only imply meaning on your screen, but not to a machine.
          &nbsp;It is much like me expecting you to find my highlighter in the
          green box of stuff with my pencil case sticking out &ndash;
          you&rsquo;d have known if you could see it. Good markup will make a
          document more analysable and readable to a computerized visitor. The
          computer needs to see labels it understands. A box labelled
          &ldquo;stationary&rdquo; may be quite useful, and a bag labelled
          highlighters within that box would help too. This will improve the
          searchability of a web page. Furthermore, it will allow screen readers
          to give a better description of the webpage, enhancing accessibility
          and understanding. It&rsquo;s just good practice to keep your
          &lsquo;stuff&rsquo; well organised. Especially if you have all kinds
          of visitors and you expect them all to find things.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is all to easy to see the internet as a visual medium. But if a
          pictures says a thousand words then sematic markup should say them
          too. That way everyone (human or computer) is on the same [web]page.
