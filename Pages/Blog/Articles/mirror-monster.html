      From unequal access <cite>[1]</cite> to racist algorithms
      <cite>[2]</cite>, it's hared to deny that the internet is riddled with
      danger, unfairness and inequality. By why? Is the interment an
      abomination: poorly connived and irresponsibly designed. Or does it merely
      reflect the injustices of society at large? Is the internet a monster -
      hard-coded with implicit braise - or a mirror - reflecting the injustice
      of society at large. Understanding what's wrong with the internet is great
      and all - but it's also high time we discussed how we can fix it

        <h2 class="main-h">What? The internet is Amazing!</h2>
        <p>
          The power and utility of the internet cannot be denied! The internet
          has the potential to connect people across the world and facilitate a
          the sharing of divers experiences and ideas <cite>[3, 4]</cite>. This
          powerful tool can transcend space and time - allowing for global
          communication knowledge sharing and commerce <cite>[3]</cite>. The
          world wide web makes information accessible to all, improving access
          to knowledge and education <cite>[4]</cite>.
        </p>
        <h3 class="main-h">&hellip; In theory yes - but in practice?</h3>
        <p>
          Not really. yes, the internet has the potential to be all of the
          above. But is doomed to fail. Internet access is not evenly
          distributed <cite>[1 ,4, 5]</cite> and a a result the internet is
          hardly a beacon of all encompassing human knowledge. Only about 59% of
          the world population has internet access <cite>[4]</cite> - but more
          disturbingly most of those who access, engage with and contribute to
          the internet are from the global north <cite>[1]</cite>. If the
          internet is to fulfil is promise of global utility and diversity
          allowing equal access must be a priority of digital justice
          <cite>[3,4]</cite>. Those without the interment will remain left
          behind, and forgotten <cite>[1, 3, 4]</cite> making digital
          representation a humanitarian issue and a basic human right
          <cite>[4]</cite>. If work is not done to provide internet access to
          all, exiting societal inequalities will be reflected and exacerbated
          in the digital space.

      <section>
        <h2 class="main-h">We made a monster.</h2>
        <p>
          But digital justice isn't really that simple. Aside from the
          logistical and concerns of providing internet to all; the internet in
          it's current form might not be as helpful as we think. We often see
          the internet (and technology as a whole) as proving solutions [5, 6]
          and answering problems.
        </p>
        <p>
          'Tech == good' people are better with tech and the problem is that
          more people need tech.
        </p>
        <p>
          This utility argument paints technology as a neutral tool. A
          benevolent medium which acts as an unbiased mirror - reflecting the
          injustices of society at large. As a result we often overlook its
          shortcoming as a lack of representation or un-just data
          <cite>[6]</cite>. How could this all be the fault of the internet?
        </p>
        <p>
          The internet isn't just here and now: is a structure of data and a
          repository of information <cite>[7]</cite>. It's not just this web
          page - it's the data behind this web page, the code that made this web
          page. It's the algorithm that gave you this web page and the data you
          give it by visiting this web page. It the analytics used to profile
          you based on visiting this web page. It's all the pages you have ever
          vistited before - all the pages that have ever exited before. All the
          data that's associated with all that and all the data that existed
          before web pages were even a thing. It's big. It's scary. It's deep.
          It's dark and it's far more than chat rooms can cat memes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most Contributions to the internet (algorithms and cat memes alike)
          disporopotiinaly represent certain demographics and thus marginalize
          others <cite>[1, 5]</cite>.Like any system with feedback - the sate of
          the internet is a function of time. The colonizing&nbsp; positive
          feedback loop of northern dominance cannot be be undone with
          flash-in-the-pan diversity. (The classic example of this is a bath
          tub, filled with boiling water - one cannot suddenly open the cold tap
          an hop in expecting not to get burnt.) Once previously
          underrepresented people/cultures/ideas are suddenly exposed to a
          dominants digital couture: they risk being overwritten and lost
          <cite>[1, 4]]</cite> rather than embraced.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2 class="main-h">But why does it matter?</h2>
        <p>
          Okay sure. The internet was made by Americans <cite>[1]</cite> - but
          we all all use it now. Avoiding all technology is ludacris. Besides,
          this tub is far too full for us to pull the plug.&nbsp; Perhaps we
          should just accept that cultures change. Society changes. Progress is
          inevitable. If you think that's bad you should hurl your device across
          the room, stop bathing and run around with a club. So there you have
          it folk. Digital digital justice is pointless. Who cares if some ideas
          are lot - we weren't using them anyway.
        </p>
        <p>
          Well, progress is inevitable but, marginalization does not have to be.
          If technology were apolitical and unbiased than there would be no
          problem - but this line of though IS the problem. Algorithms are seen
          to be mirrors - reflecting societal data. But that mirror is convex!
          It's reflection is distorted - we see monsters as a result. Algorithms
          don't just reflect societal injustice in a data set - they perpetuate
          it <cite>[6]</cite>. They may be designed as unbiased and objective
          <cite>[2, 6]</cite>
          yet they cannot transcend the limited perspectives of their creators
          <cite>[5, 6]</cite>. As software developers it is all to easy to blame
          the data instead of question the implicit biased within out own
          solution <cite>[6]</cite>. Perhaps it's hard to see. Like drops of
          water going into a bath tub. But suddenly you get an algorithm which
          appears to have been coded to crops the elderly, Africans and Muslims
          out of photographs <cite>[2]</cite>. That's one of may, may examples
          <cite>[6]</cite>. It's all very well to identify and address these
          issues as they emerge. Calls to review problematic algorithms
          <cite>[2]</cite> and engage with civil society <cite>[5, 6]</cite> are
          important steps. But I refuse to believe that people with technical
          skills are unable to address these issues during development. Even if
          problems cant' fully be solved and trade-offs have to be made, I get
          it, there are no right answers. But at least think about it.
        </p>

      <section>
        <h2 class="main-h">
          You don't need the internet; the internet needs you
        </h2>
        <p>
          Look, accidents happen. I have to concede that if I were to consider
          all of the thinks that could go and try my best to make an unbiased
          system I would fail. Something would go horribly wrong there would be
          unforeseen consequences. (well duh, that's what makes them
          unforeseen). As such, just, impartial software is impossible. And yet
          is is still an idea I believe we should strive towards.
        </p>
        <p>
          Its all well and good to say that all humans need the internet's
          information <cite>[3, 4]</cite>, but really the internet needs the
          perspectives of a diver society. Each new perspective gives new
          insights into the types of issues that could occur and the types of
          problems that need to considered. Each voice (or silent user's data
          trail) on the internet provides more data. All of these parts can only
          ever work together to make a greater whole.
        </p>
        <p>
          So you, whoever you are, whatever you think. Don't ever be fooled into
          thinking that the interment is a benevolent provider. Nature or
          nurture, monster or mirror, the internet is only ever as good as it's
          users, its creators and the data it contains. It is our duty to be
          mindful of what that is and how we contribute to is - so that one day
          the utilitarian internet of equal access and divers participation may
          become a tangible idea rather than a misguided fallacy. To put more
          than just hot water in that bath tub so that in time more people feel
          comfortable to hop in.
