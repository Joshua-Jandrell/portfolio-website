          I'm sorry I don't have time to write a good refection
        </h2>
        <p>
          I wanted to write a thoughtful flowing reflection. The kind that
          meanders though and array of disparate ideas, dances with analogies
          and then ties them together in a beautiful bow. You know that
          pretentious, try-hard word-salad gibberish that I often chuck in here.
        </p>
        <p>I wanted to do that.</p>
        <p>I really wanted to.</p>
        <p>But I can't.</p>
        <p>
          It's 4am and I submit at 5pm. After typing this out on word (because I
          can't spell to save my life and need spell check). I'lll need to
          painstakingly copy past each paragraph into the correct containers.
        </p>
        <p>
          See! Just by stating this new line I've made more work for myself!
        </p>
        <p>
          I'll then spend a bunch of time deliberating microformats and realize
          I've been using one of them wrong. So I'll go back and change
          everything. And not, I can't jut ctrl+f ctrl+r because I used it right
          some of the time - just not always. (on another day I'd make my key
          strokes look like arrows but I have too much to do and too little
          time.) And I have loadshedding in a couple hours…

        <p>
          That's a very good question. The short answer is I over think
          everting. But I knew that from day one. I knew I was doing this to
          myself. I knew what I was doing to myself, and I still did it!
        </p>
        <p>
          You know, every section I type makes me even more of an asshole. You
          see I have an index for these blog posts so there needs to be a link
          to every section heading. At the time of putting that into a wire
          frame this didn't seem like a problem.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Hmmmm I lose nothing if I include this so if not, why not? Right?”
        </p>
        <p>
          Wrong! Past-me wrong! A thousand million times wrong! (Oh gosh MS Word
          is already telling me to be more concise).
        </p>
        <p>
          My suffering is a death by a thousand cuts. A hundred small things
          that like a blog index that are easy to implement in isolation but
          scale abysmally. So what if it's a few lines and I can copy past. I
          have to do it over and over and over and over again.
        </p>
        <p>
          I want to have links to other blogs at the bottom of this post - well
          gee. I better go find some. And past this blog at the bottom of all
          the other posts. That's going to be great fun when I have over one
          hundred blog posts. What an exponential headache.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is why I hate html (at least for now). I hate it because it makes
          everting hard. In my book programming is about making life easier,
          automating redundant processes and removing repetitive tasks. But html
          isn't programming: It's markup, which appears to mean the opposite of
          all that. Each time you want to do anything you have to make a
          detailed not about it. And if you want any sort of versatile
          navigation you need to make a reference to that note in 500 other
          places.
        </p>
        <p class="retoric" aria-roledescription="reotric">
          Well yup. That's kinda the whole idea of hypertext markup&hellip;
        </p>
        <p>
          Nothing is scalable! The more you do the harder it gets! And, if you
          like me and are prone to making long flowery word salads this process
          is painful. I am of the view that html should never be automated. It
          should never be written by humans unless as a form of torture.
        </p>
        <p>
          I hope to automate this nonsense with JavaScript soon so may pain will
          end. (Or I'll make more pain faffin with a broken JS script).
        </p>
        <p class="retoric" aria-roledescription="reotric">
          You just wrote a page about how you hate html. What does this have to
          do with your website? (and are you okay?)
        </p>
        <p>
          What's my site made with? Rainbows and cat's vomit? (Yeah, I'm fine.
          Thank for checking). Okay let me be honest with myself.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="s_2">
        <h2 class="main-h">I over scoped</h2>
        <p>
          I added a bunch of things which I though would be trivial without
          understanding how they world work together. Html isn't the problem -
          It's me. When I design a system in other programming languages I think
          in code. I can see it all in my head. It feels logical, the system
          informs the design. I don't understand html well enough to do this
          yet. As my homepage suggests, I'm still printing 'hello world.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm a novice but I wanted by site to be extradentary. I had stary eyes
          and visons of gravure. I wanted to wow visitors with polished CSS and
          an solid structure. I wanted to show off skills I didn't have.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is all to easy to see the internet as a visual medium. But if a
          pictures says a thousand words then sematic markup should say them
          too. That way everyone (human or computer) is on the same [web]page.
        </p>
        <p>
          While programming the site I spent hours, not days, on non-essential
          features while the main structure didn't exist. I would faff about how
          clicking on a link felt even though it just led to error 404. I had my
          priorities mixed up. I was so obsessed with that extra ten percent
          that would give the site the x-factor that I forgot the 90 percent
          that would make the site work.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm angry with html because it can't do what I should only be doing
          later with JavaScript. I should accept that some plans can be
          implemented later. I should say “not now” but I can't. And that's my
          biggest failure.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="s_3">
        <h2 class="main-h">I don't know how to say, 'good enough.'</h2>
        <p>
          Everything I have put on this site has a justification behind it.
          Goodness knows I won't have time to explain it all and you won't have
          time to read it. But trust me - it does.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have spent countless hours deliberating. Adding things and removing
          remobing them. Not to and countless more faffing with CSS. This is why
          I feel like I work so slowly and that I can't get anything done.
        </p>
        <p>
          The extra time taken, and extra work required never seem to be valid
          justification to me. I dismiss such concerns as laziness and insist to
          keep working to make things right.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have ploughed relentlessly through the night, unable to sleep, even
          during load shedding, because I feel there is more work that must be
          done. That isn't healthy and this site isn't looking much better…
        </p>
        <p>
          The worst part is when I look back at it all I didn't even address the
          things that truly mattered. I screwed around with stuff that was find,
          even though there are still serious issues which need to be resolved
          (like this refection).
        </p>
        <p>
          The urge to keep working is irrational and illogic. It is not directed
          to constructive progress (even if I tell myself, it is). It is work
          for the sake of work, because nothing will ever be perfect, and I need
          to learn to accept that and move on.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="s_4">No time management</section>
      <p>
        I never had a timeline or any millstones when working on the site. I had
        a few loose once but I never stuck to them because they were never
        formalised. This lead to the task simply expanding to fill the time
        allocated. With neither the task nor the time clearly defined, this
        expansion has engulfed my existence.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is not healthy and I need to protect myself against it moving
        forward. This is no the first time I've got to a state like this, but I
        need to do something about it.
      </p>
      <p>
        From now on the work on this site will be governed by clear, time bound
        milestones. One the delaine for a section has passed I stop working on
        it (unless there is a glaring flaw). Sure, it won't be perfect. But nor
        is the site in its current state. If I'd had better time management I'd
        probably be polishing instead of panicking (or better yet sleeping).
      </p>
      <p>
        Anyhow I've rambled on about my poor time management and impulsive work
        practices for long enough. Let's take a look at the site itself. I will
        not be reexplaining the intentions I described in the dev-log because
        this is tedious and redundant. I will be discussing wither or not the
        site is functioning as intended.
      </p>
      <p>
        I will also be mentioning issues that I simply (and truly) do not have
        the time to address. I feel guilty saying this. It feels like a poor
        excuse. I promise I will fix them all, just not right now.
      </p>
      <section id="s_5">
        <h2 id="main-h">Evaluating the styling</h2>
        <p>
          I am pleased with the orange and blue colour scheme. The two shades I
          have chosen are working well together. These contrasting colures make
          each other pop rather than clashing and the site looks better than I
          had imagined in them. They give the index (and the entire site) the
          sense of enthusiasm and balance I had intended while still feeling
          joyful and peaceful. I did have to limit it to one hue of each colour
          to ensure the pallet did not feel too chaotic.
        </p>
        <p>
          I did not execute my original concept of minimalism very effectively.
          I used a lot more decorative shapes and lines than I had initially
          intended. The site is abstract but perhaps not minimal. I enjoy the
          sense of structure and variety that these elements add. I am
          especially pleased with the time-line motif of the dev-log. It's
          aesthetically pleasing and gives the site more presence. The strong
          bold lines and grid layouts convey a sense of purpose drive and
          confidence.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am also pleased with the square brackets and commented sub-headings.
          I find both to be visually appealing and they evoke the idea of
          programming and writing code (which is something I like to do). I do
          feel the heading decorations can be overused at times: I should think
          carefully about how frequently I use them so that they remain
          interesting and don't become overused or stale.
        </p>
        <p>
          The monospace font can be a bit jarring; I am please I did not use it
          for body text. It is not the most aesthetically pleasing - but it also
          speaks to programming so and fits the theme well.
        </p>
        <p>
          I don't know why but I don't like the navigation bar. Something feels
          off about it but I can't put my finger on it. It's too light and
          floaty compared to the big bold section heeding. I probably just need
          to play around with the styling, but that's a task for another
          day&hellip;
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="s_6">
        <h2 class="main-h">Evaluating the structure</h2>
        <p>
          I think that putting all of the section on the home page works out
          well. Everting is in once place for the visitor and they no-loner have
          the onus of finding section themselves (although they still can if
          they want to).
        </p>
        <p>
          The 'Hello World' introduction section is impactful, but it doesn't
          feel like it belongs with the rest of the site. It was one of those
          impressive bits of polish I added for the sake of being impressive.
          Sure it looks cool but I may also confuse visitors who expect to land
          on a more traditional site. The best way to determine this sections
          future will be user testing. (If it try to decide myself I will just
          think in circles).
        </p>
        <p>
          The about section feels more cluttered than the other sections despite
          not being to text heavy. It may help to add a solid boarder somewhere
          to reinforce the concept of structure which is more prominent
          elsewhere in the site.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm happy with the structure of the other index sections, although the
          games and explore portions feel rather bland There isn't much going on
          with them and its hardly exciting. The dev-log section is quite busy
          but looks well organised. The contact is probably my favourite: it is
          slick, minimal and does the job.
        </p>
        <p>
          I need to re-evaluate how the blog section is presented. The current
          format is great for one or two blog posts but may be problematic once
          I start adding more.
        </p>
        ]
        <p>
          The blog page layout is fine - pretty standard nothing inventive or
          extraordinary. The back button seems out of place wherever I put it.
          The dev-log back button has a similar issue, this feature needs a more
          consistent and appropriate section.
        </p>
        <p>
          I think that the timeline like display in the dev-log section turned
          out great. It look interesting, conveys meaning and provides structure
          to the page. However, the index section for the dev-log is long,
          cumbersome and cluttered already. Using a continuous document may not
          be the best approach. The dev-log html is already unwieldly to manage;
          the sheer size of the page could increase loading time and effect
          performance. I'm also concerned about the &lt;details&gt; and
          &lt;summary&gt widgets on this page. It is not immediately clear that
          each heading will expand to revied the full article. The block of text
          used to summarise the article might be confused for the article
          itself. Furthermore, the widget has no CSS transition which makes it
          hard for a suer to see the change they cased. I sometimes don't notice
          when I have opened a dev log article. I can style this to be more
          clear, but that might add clutter and look messy.
        </p>
        <p>
          The games pages are my favourite. I like how they look and I like how
          it feels to hover over the downloads and what the square brackets
          expand. I was concerned about using orange boarder for the images in
          this section, but it worked out well and thinks don't seem to clash
          too much. My only gripe is that the back (“return”) button isn't where
          I said it would be on the wireframe. I have been very indecisive about
          the placement of this element and hardly feel this break the design.
          However, it is not consistent with the placement on the other pages
          which may cause confusion.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="s_7">
        <h2 id="main-h">Reflecting on hypertext</h2>
        <p>
          Hyperlinks are generally displayed clearly. They are wither underlined
          or implied by being placed in a navigation element. The feedback given
          when a mouse hovering over a hyperlink is generally good. The use CSS
          transitions makes hovering over hypertext feel exciting and
          interactive with the page almost coming to life. That said - the
          communication for hypertext is not consistent, even within the
          navigation sections. I think I should define a clear styling
          convention and mouse hover behaviour moving forward.
        </p>
        <p>
          The pop-out text used in the about section is a failure. I was
          intended to create flexible and expandable passages of hypertext and
          make reading feel like and act of discovery. (It would also allow me
          to add asides like this one without breaking the flow). Unfortunately,
          it looks messy and feels clunky. A clickable inline anchor is
          conventionally a hyperlink - that is what the user expect the pop-out
          text to be. I tried giving these a district colour and decoration
          however their functionality s still unclear. Having text pop out on
          hover could be a compromise but I will need too find a way to make
          this functionality accessible to screen reader users.

        <p>
          Because I have been faffing so much I have not tested this website on
          other devices with different screen sizes. I make extensive use for
          CSS grid elements and I'm not sure how these will look on different
          browsers. I am aware that things on my site start looking weird once

        <p>
          Okay, this has been quite a rant. Thank you for barring with me. Much
          like my website this blog post has been long, posiibly teidious and
          seeminhly directionless. It's hard to tie all that up with a little
          bow: but one can ony try. My website isn't bad, but it's not great
          either. I feel its passible and I am happy with most of its features.
          However, It is still incomplete and needs a lot of work. The lack
          adaptive CSS for varied screen sizes is a major flaw.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am disappointed with the site (and myself) because I feel that it
          doesn't reflect the time and effort I put it. In the end 10% was
          faffed and 90% was rushed. I did not have a clear action plan and let
          myself down with poor time mazement and bad prioritization. I tricked
          myself into thinking that as long as I kept on working at it thinks
          would be okay. I gave myself more work by restarting 4 times.
        </p>
        <p>
          I know I should not do these things. Yet I still do them. I have made
          similar mistakes many times before. It's hight time I learnt to learn
          from them.
