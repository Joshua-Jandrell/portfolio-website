          It's been a while since I did any high level design work on my
          website. It's time to dive back I and take a critical look the user
          interface (UI) and the user experience (UX) of the website. What is
          good, what is bad and what can I do to fix it?

          Delivering a good UX is critical to making a good site. Well sort of.
          The user experience is a confluence between the experiential and
          emotional affects of interacting with an artifact as well the context
          where in this interaction takes place <cite>[1]</cite>. The experience
          that a user has while using an artifact has a clear impact on their
          engagement engage with it and how they evaluate it's quality after
          using it <cite>[1][2]</cite>. Delivering the desired experience will
          result in the website evoking the intended response. UX is especially
          important for a portfolio website like mine because, let's face it,
          you have no real reason to be here. There is not task you need to
          accomplish on this site, I'm just doing the best I can to entertain
          you.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>No, please don't go!</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          As much as one can try to make a good UX - the experience itself lies
          with the user. But that doesn't mean that UX isn't my responsibility.
          As a designers I must create the context for a certain experience to
          take place <cite>[1]</cite>. The user interface (the interface between
          the cite and the user - shocking I know) and the general tone,
          structure and style of the site give me good opportunities to do this.
        </p>
        <p>
          Okay that's all well and good - but how have I don't with the UI and
          UX so far. In this article I'm going to take a look at how I have
          succeeded, how I have failed and what I can do to make things work
        </p>

        <h2 class="main-h">The Good</h2>
        <h3 class="main-h">A strong first impression</h3>
        <p>
          I have been mindful of the UX from the start - literally. When first
          land on the website they are greeted by a glorious "hello world"
          message which smoothly slides away to reveal the homepage. This
          opening sequence starts things off on a good note, making the site
          appear intreating, exciting and well-made (I hope). First impression
          are critical because they establish the context for further
          engagement[2]. Web usurers seldom change their opinion of a website
          after continued use (provided there are not glaring issues) and will
          often form this opinion in as little as 50
          milliseconds<cite>[2]</cite>.
        </p>
        <h3 class="main-h">Interactive links</h3>
        <p>
          All links move and change with CSS when the user hovers over them in
          one way or another. This makes it clear that an action is available -
          a good practice UI design - it's always a good idea to show the user
          what they can do <cite>[3]</cite>. Features like animations give a
          sense of energy and intrigue while improving communication. This
          'juice' allows the user to navigate my site more easily and have more
          fun while doing it!. Those links really do feel satisfying to click,
          don't they?
        </p>
        <h3 class="main-h">Showing visitors around</h3>
        <p>
          Users can experience all of the section of my website by simply
          scrolling. It's that easy. They don't have to click any links to see
          blog and games and other interesting sections. it's all right there
          for them to enjoy. Scrolling is effortless digital navigation. it
          makes pages on the site feel closer to each other rn space and time
          which should make users more comfortable while traversing my hypertext
          <cite>[4]</cite>.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="retoric" aria-roledescription="Weary Trvelaer:"
            >Does this mean the UI navigation is good?</span
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          Yes! It's great. It's super easy for users to get to games, blog post
          and any other pages they with to visit. It's al right there for them.

        <p>
          Ummm, yes. I just said it did. The reader do here to read this afer
          all didn't they. The mere face that this is con screen roves my point.

            A really bad door. A door that requires the user to ack against

        <p>But this is a website, not a door. I don't understand.</p>

            I have been stuck on this page for three week and I a have no clue
            how to get back to the home page. Your site is like a door with two
            pull handles. Coming in is great but going back out again is
            completely confusing.
          </p>
          <p>
            The return button is always floating somewhere in the middle of the
            article and I have to scroll around to find it.

            One minute [this] is a button. The next it's some random decoration!
          </p>
          <p>
            Headings, links and nav sections all look different. The layout
            keeps changing fraom section to section. Just as I learn where
            things are on one page I go to ne next and everything changes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Making your user relearn things again and again is frustrating and
            tiring for them<cite>[5]</cite>. It is the opposite of a good user
            interface and a good user experience. Adhering to you own standards
            and conventions will make your site easier to understand. Users will
            need to spend less time yanking on push doors trying to return to
            your home page and more time strolling around, oblivious to doors,
            and admiring the view.
          </p>
          <p>
            It's all well and good to make a great first impression but good UX
            and UI often goes unnoticed <cite>[1][3]</cite> - as it should. An
            action should be effortless.
          </p>
          <p>
            On the other hand, just one interaction is enough to aggravate and
            frustrate the user<cite>[1]</cite>. Once they have a bad impression
            of your site it'll probably stick <cite>[1][2]</cite>. Once users
            associate your site with frustration and navigation difficulties
            they'll be unlikely to come back - the digital space will hold
            negative connotations<cite>[4]</cite>.
