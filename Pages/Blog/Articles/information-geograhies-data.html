            >Information has always had geography. It is from somewhere; about
            somewhere; it evolves and is transformed somewhere; it is mediated
            by networks, infrastructures, and technologies: all of which exist
            in physical, material places.</q

        </p>
        <p>
          Graham et al seek to immediately establish that information is
          inevitably linked to geography and physical location. Information is
          held somewhere and for it to be transferred it must be moved somewhere
          else. However the geography of information is not merely limited to
          where it is stored. Information is influenced by the culture and
          context of the location it is created in. And, in turn the politics of
          an area are shaped by the information accessible within the area (and
          perhaps also the information about the area).
        </p>
        <p>
          It is acknowledge that sometimes the location of information seems
          separate from the information itself. In the same way that an oral
          story can slowly be embellished with the the personal experience of
          each story-tell who passes it on, the geographic context of
          information can be over-written by each region in which it exists. As
          the location of information changes, its context changes, thus the
          manner in which the information is understood and transformed
          transformed changes. Information is altered and adapted when exposed
          to new contexts. However, according to Graham et al not that this is
          not always the case.

            >It is precisely this mobility and adaptability of information that
            provides the motivation to constrain the mutability of information
            through the creation of what Latour (1986) refers to as 'immutable
            mobiles' or information that can be transported without significant
            change to its inherent characteristics or meaning.</q

        <p>
          Graham et al view immutable mobiles s as essentially physical
          manifestations of information. They are tangible artifacts: books,
          newspapers, maps and pamphlets that are encoded with geographic
          information that cannot be overwritten by transportation. Fixing the
          information to a physical object allows it to be detached from its
          location. Although unaltered by travel, immutable mobiles is still
          completely bound by space and time - and are thus bound by geography.
        </p>
        <p>
          But what about the internet? It appears to have transcended space.
          Surly it is not contained within a location or a physical artifact?
          The article addresses this next.

            immutable mobiles through the creation of '(im)mutable
            augmentations' characterized by the layering of dynamic information
            across and over geographic space. Thus, not only does information
            have particular geographies, but geography itself is layered,
            defined, and augmented by information that is more or less
            immutable</q
          ><cite class="noDisplay">(Graham el at, 2015)</cite>
        </p>
        <p>
          Thoughts, opinions and ideas surrounding any location are themselves
          localized (not necessarily in the same location as they describe). Yet
          ICTs allow this information to be transmitted across the globe in an
          unaltered and immutable form. Information about a location comes form
          across the planet and information from a location is spread across the
          planet.
        </p>
        <p>
          Is this not just globalization? The internet has given us the global
          village. Perhaps the location of information is now planet earth? No.
          Distinct cultural practices and ways of though still exist in
          different areas. These traditions and perspective have not suddenly
          become homogenous by simple being connected to one another. Despite
          how alarmingly uniform the internet may appear.
        </p>
        <p>
          I feel that as similar argument could be made on a micro scale.
          Numerous schools of thought exist within a single geographical rejoin
          - country, province, city, town, building, room. The location of
          information matters - but so does its greater context. The personal
          experiences of an other might have a greater impact on their work than
          location in which they write. It cannot be debated that hegemonic mode
          of a location will shape its information however it is not the only
          factor. Graham et al acknowledge that more detailed and nuanced
          socio-economic issues should be investigated however, acquiring and
          displaying comparable data to describe this on a global scale is not
          an easy task. Geography may be one of many other factors impacting
          information but perhaps it is the easiest to measure.

          Graham et al raise the concern that the immutable digital
          augmentations layers from one geographic location onto another are
          overwriting and superseding the exiting information of that location.
          Furthermore some geographic are so underrepresented that they might as
          well not exist. An underrepresented location is like restaurant which
          does not appear on a map - doomed to be ignore until it goes out of
          business and it completely and utterly forgotten.

        <p>
          Graham et al explain that information is power. If one controls the
          hegemonic narrative they wield power over the ways of though in an
          area. The article note that, prior to the digital era this control of
          information was relatively easy. Producing and engaging with immutable
          mobiles - such as printed books, maps or academic journals - was a
          privileges only afforded to a select few. The equipment, skill,
          finance an coordination required for the production of immutable
          mobiles was limited to large organizations such as governments and
          academic intuitions. Generally these intuitions (and their power) were
          located in the global North. There knowledge, bond to physical
          artifacts, was not slow moving and often contained in place of power.
          The South lacked the tools to contribute to this collection of
          information and were doomed to be spoken about rather than to speak.
          Graham et al wish to establish the historical backdrop with this
          point. The pre-digital distribution of knowledge and power have had a
          profound impact on how the world is shaped and, as the article argues,
          persist to this day.

        <h2 class="main-h">The digital 'revulsion'</h2>
        <p>
          Graham et al explain that following the invention of ICTs, there was
          an idyllic optimism that this new technology would overcome the wrongs
          of the past and bring about an era of equal geographic access,
          representation and participation.

            >[f]or the first time in a millennium, we have a technology to

            geographic placing</q

        </p>
        <p>
          According to the data provided in the article, this idea was a myth.
          The apparent omnipresence of the internet (in the global North) has
          made the world wide web an important battleground for political
          control. The means of production and distribution of information are
          less centralized and thus pollical ideals must be spread more
          violently. The internet is no a mere publication which can be
          censored; its (im)mutable augmentations must be challenged and
          overwritten more velociously. This is no longer the pursuit of large
          institutions but of each individual who wishes to make their opinion
          know. And these opinions and information are inevitably shaped by
          their location.
        </p>
        <p>
          The article provides data to indicate that the global North is wield
          disproportionate power in the digital realm - with higher access,
          participation and representation. The South remain excluded,
          underrepresented and overwritten by northern information. Graham et al
          have established that because of the (im)mutable nature of the digital
          space, the deficit in southern contribution could lead to the
          overwriting and/or negation of information, cultures, politics and
          ideas in underrepresented rejoins. The North still hold hegemonic
          dominance and this is brining about a new epistemicide.
        </p>
        <p>
          Establishing this context highlights the importance of the data which
          Graham et al are about to present. This preamble is of as much value
          as the data: unpacking the dangers and the stakes of digital
          colonialism and debunking the internet as a global medium of
          apolitical utility.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now that the argument has been outline it is time to present data
          showing the geographic inequality of access, participation and
          representation.

          The idyllic concept of digital ICTs is their provision of globally
          accusable information. According to Graham et al this is the most
          fundamental requirement for digital participation: without the
          capacity to access the internet there is now way for one to exist
          within it.

        <p>
          The first set of data is presented in the misshapen world map above.
          This data was collected in 2011 by the World Bank who monitor internet
          connection per country. The size of each nation is a representation of
          the total number of internet users per country. At a glace he Northern
          dominance which Graham et al alluded to is crystal clear in this
          image. the north, especially the USA and Europe are almost
          unrecognizably bloated while some African nations have shrunken out of
          existence.
        </p>
        <p>
          I feel that the coloration of the map is more significant and more
          disturbing. Darker hues represent a higher internet penetration - a
          higher internet usage per capita. Graham et al note that although
          there are some outliers the general trend is that rejoins in the
          global north are significantly darker (have a higher penetration).
          Penetration is vital because it speaks to proportional representation.
          I believe that the input of each individual is more valuable than the
          average within an area. Within a nation there are socio-economic
          differences and multiple political factions. If one is to aim for
          digital equality then each voice should be amplified equally. Iceland
          and Madagascar are the same size on the map: more than 80% of
          Iceland's population has internet access; with less than 20% for
          Madagascar. The number of users may be similar however the majority of
          Madagascan users are excluded from the internet. China and India have
          massive internet populations but this is offset by large physical
          population. India's internet penetration is less than 20% and China's
          is not much better. These two nations make up a significant proportion
          of the global population - a significant portion that is left without
          internet.
        </p>
        <p>
          The internet population of rejoins with low pentation is likely
          contain the more affluent individuals. Although not addresses in this
          study it is highly likely that digital inequalities are just as
          prevalent between fanatical groups an classes as they are across
          geographies. On a world wide scale income and economies undoubtable
          play a role in internet access as show in the second figure presented.
        </p>

        <p>
          Figure 2 shows the cost of internet access as a proportion of average
          income as recorded by the International Telecommunication Union.
          Graham et al not the stark contrast between the proportional cost of
          internet access in Africa compared to the rest of the world. It is not
          their intention of the Graham et al to explain any of the data
          acquired, however one can see clear correlation between a high
          proportional cost of internet and low internet population and
          penetration.
        </p>
        <p>
          Strangely it appears that the actual cost of internet in Africa is
          also high. Perhaps internet service providers feel that that it is
          more finically viable to only serve an affluent minority. Graham et al
          do point out that the cost of internet in Africa has been decreasing.
          Although still ridiculously high when compared to average income, one
          can hope that as this trend continues internet access will become more
          affordable of Africans.
        </p>
        <p>
          A rather ironic feature of this map are the rejoins for which no data
          is available - the majority of which are in the global south. This is
          compete lack of representation is the core issue the Graham et al are
          attempting to raise. Many world maps which display statistic lack data
          for nation in the global south. The lack of information about these
          nations suggest that they are at risk for ceasing to exist in the
          minds of those on the internet.

          Graham et al have now which to explore who is contributing to digital

          quite another to have the power to print one. The same is true about
          the power to control and contribute to information on the internet.
          Those who are contributing and articipation more have a greater
          influence over the hegemonic narrative.

        <p>
          Domain names indicate who is building the internet and where it is
          being built from. Figure 3 depicts bespoke data which was collected by
          analyzing the number of domains with particular geographic suffixes in
          their names. One would the distribution of these to be more or less
          similar to interment population however this is not the case. the
          general trend of Europe, America and Australasia having a
          disproportionally large representation continues. However the global
          south is even smaller than in Figure 1 with South America diminished
          along with Africa. Nations like Nigeria might have a large internet
          population however their contribution to the constriction of the
          internet is insignificant.
        </p>
        <p>
          The USA dominates domain creation, closely followed by Europe. The
          number of domain names in Asia, which boasts a large internet
          population, is dwarfed by the western nations. This could in part be
          due to censorship in nations like China which essentially has a
          different internet to the rest of the world. Although it is hard to
          imagine that this could explain the lack of domains in nations like
          India. Figure 3 gives a clear message that internet construction and
          participation is centered in the western nations of the global north,
          the rest of the world may have access however they are mere spectators

          It is interesting to observe that some country codes were excluded
          because these codes are often used to indicate something other than
          the origin of the domain. For example '.ac' is the country code for
          Ascension Island however, it is also used to indicate academic
          institutions. This this data had to be excluded. Ascension Island is
          one of many courtiers whose domains are not only underrepresented but
          effetely overwritten. These nations are considered so insignificant
          than people from other rejoins use their domain codes to indicate
          trivia functions such as academic institutions, start up companies and
          small holdings. There is no reason that these functions could not be
          denoted with unique acronyms, however this would required people to
          notice these minute internet nations.

          Figure 4 indicates the number of GitHub users per 100 000 interment
          users. The disparity shown in the map above cannot simply be put down
          to larger internet populations or penetrations. These disproportionate
          representation of the global north is further compounded.
        </p>
        <p>
          Graham et al motivate the use of GitHub as a metric because it is the
          largest online code sharing site. Code defines the constriction of
          digital technologies - those who write the code do not just define the
          narrative, they define the space itself
        </p>
        <p>
          The data presented in figure 4 was collected by GitHub based on users
          specified home locations. Only 26% of users did this, however this 26%
          was responsible to 44% of commits to the cite. Graham et al feel that
          there is not reason people from any one country would be less likely
          to specify their location, however I do not think this possibility can
          simply be discounted without further investigation. The north
          dominates the technical sphere: perhaps people from the global south
          or less developed counties might fear being ostracized or prejudiced
          by northerners. They fear being considered less intelligent
          characterized as bad coders because their nations are less developed.
          I have no data to support this although I do feel it would be a good
          avenue for further research. This data set may appear to be incomplete
          but it does well to display a general trend. Furthermore a skilled
          Ghanaian programmer (to give a random example) might relocate to
          silicon valley because he will ern more working as a programmer there.

        <p>
          Writing code is not dissimilar to the pre-digital information
          production. It requires specific skills and technologies that are not
          readily available to all. Graham et al are that such issues might skew
          this data and thus they examine a more general form of contribution:
          Wikpidia

          It is argued that anyone can edit Wikipedia. This supposedly makes it
          a fair measure for online contributions. The online encyclopedia is
          among the top 10 most accessed sites in 95% of the world countries -
          Graham et al note that this give it tremendous power to share content
          access across the globe.
        </p>
        <p>
          The patter in Figure 5 is not unfamiliar: the global north and former
          British colonies dominate; African participation is almost
          non-existent. The graph indicates the sheer number of contributions:
          perhaps this data is offset by internet population... The data in
          Figure 6 is a bit more profound.f

          This figure displays the amount of English language Wikipedia content
          about a country that originates from that county. It is unfortunate
          that the collection method Graham et al utilized to obtain this data
          required the use of English Language strings. As such it is
          unsurprising that most counties with greater than 50% local edits are
          predominantly English speaking former colonies.
        </p>
        <p>
          The issue of observing only English edits has a clear impact however,
          the trend of northern dominance persist. The nations with over 50%
          English langue edits happen to also be among the nation which dominate
          interment penetration, domain names, GitHub commits and General
          Wikipedia edits. An exception to this is India which has a high
          proportional contributing by virtue of having a large (English
          speaking) internet population alone. Given the distribution of digital
          power it would be a fair assumption to claim that the internet is
          predominantly English speaking, thus English language edits encompass
          the predominant digital understanding.
        </p>
        <p>
          This data is of particular concern when viewed through the lenses of
          (im)mutable augmentations. It is clear that a select few countries
          control the narrative about themselves - the rest are being
          overwritten. My home country of South Africa has less the 50% local
          edits, despite being predominantly English speaking. This is still
          significantly higher than the rest of Africa: a continent which is
          clearly not speaking but being spoken about.

          Figure 7 summarizes all of the trends observed thus far. The shocking
          disparity between digital population and digital contribution becomes
          apparent. Graham et al tent to speak in terms of the global north and
          south - however the data appears to suggest that in particular it is
          Europe, America and Australia (with New Zealand) that dominate
          internet participation and content creation.. The term global north
          may be used for convenience (for the rest of this article the 'north'
          refers specifically to Europe and America) however, I feel it it is
          important to understand that the nation with digital power are the
          same nation that wield economic power, military power, political power
          and colonial power. These nations are not divided by the equator but
          by deep routed histories which lead back to well before the digital
          era. Africa, South America, the Middle East and Asia are all under
          represented by internet perpetration and by contribution when compared
          to digital population. People from these rejoins are silent consumers
          of Euro-American information.
        </p>
        <p>
          Why do these people not participate? Is it because of censorship? Is
          it due to a lack of time? Perhaps they simply do not care to
          contribute to the types of information used as metrics. Programing
          (and code) is currently and essentially northern discipline. Most
          digital hardware and software is made by the north, for north creating
          a vicious feedback loop where the global south are alienated and
          excluded and thus have not reason to contribute or participate. The
          very nature of the Encyclopedia and the concept of discovering and
          recoding knowledge is rooted in European culture and European was of
          thinking. The concept of Wikipedia is not inherently bad, however it
          must be acknowledge that prior to the digtal era, the global north had
          a culture of record keeping while the global south did not. This
          practice is not limited to inequalities and access on the internet - I
          believe that i runs far deeper in the manner in which information has
          been stored differently in different location throughout history.

            To better understand the contours of representation within the
            (im)mutable augmentations of the world we analyse the geographies of

            world’s most used search engine), OpenStreetMap (the world’s largest
            open map), and the Semantic Web as defined by Freebase (one of the
            largest collaborative ‘knowledge bases’10) and Geonames (the world’s
            largest open gazetteer). In all of these cases, the popularity and
            openness of these systems provide useful ways to gauge the spatial
            differences in digital representation

          Figure 8 is a bit more challenging to understand at a glance compared
          to the clean bar graphs and cartographic diagram presented before
          however it still provides key information. Graham et al note that
          there are no massive geographic inequities in this google search data
          however the general trends based on internet access and internet
          population remain apparent.

          >
        </p>
        <p>
          I feel that this data being less geographically skewed should be of
          concern because this implies that the there is still information about
          courtiers but, based on what was established in the previous section,
          it was not created by those courtiers. This give the illusion of a
          fully inclusive global library. To the unwitting browser the internet
          appears to be whole and compete.
        </p>
        <p>
          Graham et al acquired the data for figure 8 by using Google's custom
          search API. Graham et al searched for each countries name in up to 23
          languages (all languages with more then 50 million native speakers)
          and supplemented the list of official place names with commonly used
          names and acronyms. The use of multiple languages is undegradable and
          justifiable; the use of 'common' names is problematic. Names common to
          who? Used by who? Which names of which courtiers are common to the
          research team. Does their experience as English speakers in the global
          north not put them at risk of acknowledging common names for some
          counties and not others. I know they though of USA and the United
          States - but did they consider Mzansi? (Autocorrect certainly does
          not). The understanding of common names inevitable skews the data -
          albeit perhaps insignificantly. The face that the globe knows the USA
          and might not know Mzansi only proves the point Graham et al are
          making.

          Chad. Chad also happens to be an English word and an English name.

          The next three figures all have a similar trend - the trend that has
          become all to clear. They are interesting because they look into the
          recoding of geography itself rather than the sum of information which
          surrounds a geographic location.

          Figure 9, the number of nodes in OpenStreetMap, tends to correlate
          with population density. There are more nodes where there are more
          people and roads - at leas this is the case outside of Europe and the
          United States which both appeared a far darker shade of green once
          more indicating a disproportionally high level of geographic
          representation. This is unsurprising given the that these are the
          location which dominate digital access and participation - naturally
          they are more represented.

          At first Figure 11 seems to indicate the same trend: Europe and
          America are bight-red with a high density of place names on GeoNames.
          Names are otherwise sparsely populated across the globe. Europe hover
          has a dense population. Figure 12, indicating GeoNames place names per
          inhabitance, give a slightly different impression. The Global south is
          not as dramatically underrepresented here as it might have initially
          appeared. In face parts of South Africa seem to have more names per
          100 inhabitance than parts Europe. America enjoys the bulk of the
          representation once and gain. Asia as a continent has been greatly
          geographically underrepresented especially considering population
          size.

        <p>
          Figure 13 summarizes the disparity of geographic information. the
          reference to actual population as well as digital population indicates
          the true nature of this gross miss representation. North America in
          particular is dramatically overrepresented while, when compared to
          population, Asia and Africa have the worst representation.
        </p>
        <p>
          The disparity in the context of digital geographic representation
          appears to be stronger from east to west than north to south. Both
          trends persist and the usual culprits (North America and Europe)
          dominate, however the change is interesting. How could nations that
          have lower internet population and supposedly contribute less have
          more geographic representations. Is someone else recoding this
          information form them? Why would it be recorded for one rejoin and not
          another.
        </p>
        <p>
          These graphs of geographic digital representation are interesting and
          do present some global trends of digital representation however the
          are highly dependent on the location of the users of each platform. As
          a citizen of the global south I must confess that iI have never heard
          of FreeBase, OpenstreetMap or GeoNames. I do not care if these are the
          larges and most accessible and editable repositories of geographic
          information. I do not engage with them, use them or contribute to
          them. If I'm honest I don't really care what is or is not one them in
          my personal capacity for that very reason.

          These metrics cannot be seen as complete and absolute data of digital
          participation or representation because their usage is itself linked
          to the cultural practices of a given area. FreeBase is clearly mostly
          used by Americans. Good for free base. Football (soccer) is the
          largest sport in the world - by far. If FreeBase can be used as a
          metric then football can too. Football is hardly played in the USA,
          this nation must be sportingly deprived and devoid all culture and
          recreation. (The validity of this example is besides the point: it is
          merely to demonstrate the fallacy of using platforms that could be
          culturally linked to geographic locations.) Much like keeping an
          encyclopedia: map making has and exploration has been integral to the
          European (and my extortion American and Australian) psyche for
          generations. There are more existing maps of these location which may
          be input into a database. Furthermore there are more people in these
          rejoins who feel it is culturally important to do so. This doesn't
          even consider the possibility that people in other courtiers might use
          small scale local alternatives.

          Yes, the point raised by Graham et al stands. The face is that
          regardless of the precise reasoning the global north still holds all
          the power on the internet. They have the majority of the proportional
          access, participation and representation. The largest of anything on
          the internet is likely to be the version they use because of exactly
          that.

          As stated in the introduction Grahame et al conclude that inflation is

          for. Spatial barriers remain key constraints for Who produces
          information is vital in the context of (im)mutable augmentations and
          power. The global south continues to be written about, forgotten and

          In many ways &ldquo;Towards a study of information geographies:
          (im)mutable augmentations and a mapping of the geographies of
          information&rdquo; is ironic. There is not doubt that the article
          contains vital insights and its content should be taken seriously
          despite possible flaws in data collection. And yet it cannot avoid the
          irony of its circumstance an irony which is no fault of he authors but
          a cruel twist of fate. The article was published In Oxford and makes
          use of a Eurocentric academic framework. It is clearly written for
          academic purposes, a practice which it concedes generally remains
          limited to the global north. The article fundamentally excludes the
          global south - it is this meta narrative which drives Grahame et al's
          point home. It is another piece of information for the north about the
          south. The poor, voiceless disenfranchised south who required the aid
          of the great powerful north.

          There are echoes of missionaries who ventured deep into 'darkest
          Africa' to 'civilize' lost souls. To 'educate' 'savages'. Some might
          have had sinister agendas but I truly thing that sad part is that
          these missionaries believed they were doing the right thing. They
          believed that the world needed their knowledge to survive.

          I fear that although such acts are now regretted and frowned up, the
          modern solution is the digital savior. When it was once pants, region
          and books it is now Wi-Fi science and the internet.
        </p>

          None of these things have to be colonial but the power-dynamic in
          which they exist makes them so. If the internet is seen as utilitarian
          salvation and true equality it is doomed to overwrite exiting cultures
          and ways of though once more. the center of the 'world' wide web is
          America - Europe is its moon - Africa is barley an meteor, doomed to
          disintegrate in its atmosphere.

          Graham et al are aware of this danger which is why they conduced this
          reperch and published this paper to inform others. The debunked the
          myth on the apolitical and no geographic internet and highlighted that
          historic divides persist. They even they appeared to hold a deep set
          belief that this is what the internet should aspire to become. I
          agree.
        </p>

          I fear this cannot be achieved with random random expansion and
          imposition. One must understand that up to this point digital
          technology has been built for northern needs on norther ideas. The
          internet is itself an immutable mobile and thus holds immense power.
        </p>
        <p>
          Graham et al feel that future research should be done to investigate
          how an why each of these inequalities occurred and how they may be
          rectified. They also feel that research should be done to interrogate
          digital inequalities beyond representation.
        </p>
        <p>
          I feel that along with the above more research should be done into
          creating and internet for the global south - and infract for each and
          every school of though possible. This should not be a webpage or
          artifact that simply slips into the current norther framework. It
          should not be a parody of what is already there. My hope is that the
          social and cultural needs of each rejoin can be understood and a
          digital system could be constructed that would enhance these features
          rather than overwriting them.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is evident that many people are excluded from participation in the
          current system and research should be done into ensuring the web
          adapts to be more approachable t the entire world and not just English
          speaking former colonies.
        </p>
        <p>
          More research should also be conduced into trends over time. Graham et
          al allude to to the trajectories of the data by do not explicitly
          unpack of display them. Static images are useful but dynamic mappings
          give a more coherent idea of how power is shifting. It is important to
          map any system with multiple feedback loops over time in order to
          analyze it effectively. Perhaps all of the concerns raised above are
          foolish as the world is moving to a more inclusive. perhaps the lack
          of participation has been exacerbated. Th data in this paper should be
          plotted regularly so that the nature of these trends may be observed
        </p>
        <p>
          The key message of Graham et al in this text is a call to action. A
          call to get together as a human collective and figure out how a truly
          world word web could exist. More research should be done into how this
          is possible, if it is possible, how its creation should be managed and
          weather or not the internet should exist globally at all - with a
          particular focus on new invocative alternatives.
