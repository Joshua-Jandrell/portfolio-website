        Every entry added to an unoptimized dev-log is an entry wasted. As it
        stands it’s a monolithic block of html and I’m sick of it. It’s hard to
        work on, tricky to navigate and impossible to maintain. . I know I’m
        going to redo this whole thing, It’s just a matter of time.

      <section>
        <h3 class="dev-h">What’s the problem?</h3>
        <p>There are several:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Firstly: The left-hand index is not scrollable and gives users no
            indication of where they are in the dev-log.
          </li>
          <li>
            Secondly: Sections pop open allowing users to read more articles.
            This is fine if the reader starts at the top and moves down. But
            what if they want to move up the log? They currently need to scroll
            all the way though the article they just read which is hardly
            conveniently.
          </li>
          <li>
            Thirdly: Things could be more fluid. The details/summary tags are
            the correct approach; however they jump open suddenly which might
            confuse the user if they follow a link to a section that remains
            cloased then they get there. What if they think there is no more
            content to be found?
          </li>
          <li>
            Finally: The log is getting cumbersome and tedious to manage. The
            html is long and only growing. Even simple tasks like setting up
            index links can be tedious. Ideally, I would automat the entire
            thing – but I have no backend on Git-hub pages. I think I can still
            make my life easier than it is now.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>Now that I know what's wrong, it's time to start fixing.</p>
