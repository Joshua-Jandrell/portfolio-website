        Up until quite recently most of the dev-log has been scattered across
        disparate document. Some of it was interesting. Some of it was hot
        garbage. Most of it will be lost to time.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm currently in the process of adding the relevant entries here. This
        is a short refection of some other the prominent previous iterations of
        the site. (I really do faff a lot).

        <p>
          Yes. Because it's irrelevant. Many of the old entries related to
          abandoned designs. Typing them all out would be tedious and quite
          unnecessary. Why should I explaining why I did what I decided not to
          do.

          Okay. True. It does. But I think I'll be easier if I summarise it.
          Instead of giving the excruciating details I am prone to provide.

        <p>Without further ado; here are some of my abandoned ideas:</p>

      <section class="re_re_reboot_0_sunrise">
        <h3 class="dev-h">The Sunrise</h3>
        <p>
          This website was originally going to be styled to look like a sunrise…
          with each page based on the sky.
        </p>
        <img
          class="log-img"
          id="re_re_reboot_0_sunimg_0"
          load-src="Pages/Dev-log/Re-re-reboot_0-images/sky-concept.png"
          alt="Conept art for blue-print themed dev-log"
        /><br />
        <label for="#re_re_reboot_0_sunimg_0" class="log-label">
          Concept art for the homepage sunrise.
        </label>
        <p>
          When visitors first landed on my homepage, they would be greeted by a
          night sky. As they scrolled down, a glowing sun would rise and
          illuminate the page. A beautiful first impression! After that each
          page would have a sunrise background to continue the motif.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is the first website I've ever made - sunrises speak to the idea
          of new beginnings. An open sky invokes the idea of freedom and
          limitless possibilities. I also love watching the sunrise, I find it
          calming and relaxing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Furthermore, the sunrise let me use an awesome orange and blue colour
          scheme. The vibrant and energetic orange symbolised energy and
          enthusiasm while blue tempered this with a calm and trustworthy tones.
          Orange and blue are also contrasting colours so suing they could
          really make each-other pop (or clash horribly if done wrong).

          It was convoluted and the code I was using was a mess. It was becoming
          a pain to implement. It wasn't looking that great either. I was new to
          html and the site was crippled by a misshapn skeleton. It dawned on me
          that while the sunrise spoke to my experience of making the website it
          was completely unrelated to my skills as an engineer and game
          designer. I felt that visitors to the site would have not idea what it
          meant, what I did or what was going on.
        </p>
        <p>
          In hindsight this was not a bad idea. (I was even tempted to revert to
          it. The git branch for this reboot is even called 'back-to-sky'). It
          had the potential to be very aesthetically pleasing and was filled
          with a lot of good ideas.
        </p>
        <p>
          The 'hello' world into screen and final colour scheme were both
          cannibalised form this iteration. As was my choice to use simple and
          readable body text.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="re_re_reboot_0_stars">
        <h3 class="dev-h">Star gazing</h3>
        <p>
          This was a haphazard branch of the sunrise theme, originally intended
          to be the design form my dev-log. I had the idea of arranging elements
          on my website in constellations. I wanted exploring the site to feel
          like looking though the night sky invoking awe and wonder.
        </p>

          class="log-img"

        <p>
          Setting something like this up is hard and I was trying to show off
          with skills I didn't have. (Funny enough I think I could pull it off
          now, but I know I shouldn't). This iteration had all the bad parts of
          the sky one. The design rationale was essentially: “it looks cool, and
          I like space” The consultations were messy and hard to code. I stopped
          working on the site and lost motivation.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="re_re_reboot_0_blueprint">
        <h3 class="dev-h">Bluprints</h3>
        <p>
          An ironic theme for a failed plan. This time round the idea had reason
          and logic to it. Blueprints speak to creativity and design. They
          reflect technical capability and look awful.
        </p>
        <img
          class="log-img"
          id="re_re_reboot_0_blueimg_0"

        <p>
          To be fair they could've looked good, but I didn't have a defined
          style guid, just a vague idea. As a result, I potted around with
          'blue-print-like' styling. I wanted the site to look cutting edge but
          instead it looked like it came from the 90's.
        </p>
        <img
          class="log-img"
          id="re_re_reboot_0_blueimg_1"
          load-src="Pages/Dev-log/Re-re-reboot_0-images/Blue-screenshot.png"
          alt="A screen shot of the old bluprint devlog"

        </label>
        <p>
          Again, not a bad idea, but horrid execution. Even now I am shuddering.
          My mind is scarred with 'error screen blue'.
        </p>
        <p>
          The wireframes for this iteration however where great and I recycled
          some of their concepts for the final build. You may recognise the
          dev-log timeline.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="re_re_reboot_0_rainbow">
        <h3 class="div-h">Rainbows</h3>
        <p>
          This was the next notable idea I had, and it formed the framework for
          the site you are on right now. I'd begun to realize a pattern with my
          failed sites. The ideas were great, the rational was decent and the
          implementation was hideous. Maybe my ideas were too big. Maybe I was
          giving up to early. Maybe I wasn't focused. Most likely it was all the
          above.
        </p>
        <p>
          A lot of the style and structure details for rainbows have been
          implemented here, so you'll see plenty abridged versions of my
          rambling in this log. Rainbows was less about styling and more about a
          philosophy.
        </p>
        <p>
          This time round I was focused on what the site said and how it felt,
          rather than how it looked. I tried to be minimal in my approach to
          avoid technical pit falls and I planned less and did more.
        </p>
        <p>
          All my previous work had been subject to meticulous planning and
          over-design. I spent hours saying what I was going to do and then
          doing nothing. Rainbows meant to be more hands on. I defined a core
          theme and style and then I was to set about building a page that would
          fit it. Little by little, line by line.
        </p>
        <p>
          Importunely I'm still prone to massive deliberation. CSS is a deep
          rabbit-hole and sematic markup is a bottomless pit. I stubbled down
          both on my occasion along with an inability to make simple design
          choices without 5000 revisions.
        </p>
        <p>
          I still need to learn how to move on and say good enough is good
          enough. But I am leaning, and I will get there.

          The only major feature I dropped from rainbows was the colour-scheme.
          I used all colours of the rainbow to make the site look vibrant and
          colourful. This destroyed all legibility and compositional unity. All
          the colours were just a bit too much.
