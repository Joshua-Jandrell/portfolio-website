      After the blog section is the dev-log (development log) which keeps record
      of all the trials and tribulations while making the site. It will included
      styles guides, wireframes, reflections and wellâ€¦ you know because you're
      here.</span

        <p>
          It's basically a design journal for this site. Documenting the website
          design process helps me design and show that I am a thoughtful
          designer. It allows visitors (and myself) to understand what I was
          doing and possibly learn from my successes and mistakes.

        <h3 class="dev-h">How will the dev-log section be structured?</h3>

          <img
            class="log-img big"
            id="dev_wire_frame-img"
            src="Wire-frames/devlog-section-wire.png"
            alt="The wire frame for the dev-log section"
          /><br />
          <label for="#dev_wire_frame-img" class="log-label">
            Wireframe for the dev-log section
          </label>
        </article>
        <p>
          Similar structure to blog because it has similar features: periodic
          entries.
        </p>
        <p>
          List and featured articles swap position for visual variety, making
          the dev-log feel distinct and separate from the blog.
        </p>
        <p>
          The scroll list entri will be displayed as a time-line to show that
          develoment is a continous process with icremental installments the
          build on each-other.

          <img
            class="log-img big"
            id="dev_page_wire_frame-img"
            src="Wire-frames/devlog-wire.png"
            alt="The wire frame for the dev-log page"
          /><br />
          <label for="#dev_page_wire_frame-img" class="log-label">
            Wireframe for the dev-log (this page)
          </label>
        </article>
        <p>Unlike blog the dev-log is one continues document.</p>
        <p class="retoric" aria-roledescription="retoric">WHY?</p>
        <p>
          Because this shows that development is a continuous process and that
          or articles are related and follow chronologically. In contrast each
          blog post convers a different topic.
        </p>
        <p>
          The timeline motif will be in the main dev-log section to show that it
          is a cautious process. This also indicates that entireties build on
          what has already be done.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sections in the dev-log will be collapsed using the &lt;details&gt;
          and &lt;summary&gt; widget so that users can scroll through the log
          more easily.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am slightly concerned that with time a single continuous document of
          this nature will become difficult to manage and slow to load. I may
          need to add some sort of document fetching system using JS.
