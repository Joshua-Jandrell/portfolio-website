        <h3 class="dev-h">Another reboot?</h3>
        <p>
          Yes, I’m afraid so. This site is an unimaginable mess. What you see?
          Maybe not. But just look at all these random folders in
          <a
            href="https://github.com/Joshua-Jandrell/portfolio-website.git"
            class="inline-link"
            target="_blank"
            rel="external"
            >my repo</a
          >. But this one is different because I know what I’m going do in
          advance. I figure I should write about it because time is short and by
          the time my outstanding logs are in, they will have become obsolete.
        </p>
        <p class="retoric">Outstanding logs?</p>
        <p>
          You know all the stuff that I’ve done and want to talk about in the
          dev-log. Only I haven’t got round tow writing and article, editing
          what I’ve written or formatting it as html.
        </p>
        <p class="retoric">Surely that shouldn’t take you too long?</p>
        <p>
          I mean, I tend to faff so who knows. The problem is that formatting my
          writing with markup is definitely my least favourite part - so it'll
          take some time and will power. I find it slow, and tedious especially
          when it comes to adding hyperlinks and code.
        </p>
        <p>
          I know, I should make the log entries consistently as I do my tasks.
          But I kind of do. I have rough draughts form most of them in word or
          on random bits of paper. The problem is there are so many other cool
          things I’d rather do with my website. Since I started with JavaScript
          I have I’ve been having an absolute blast pushing the limits of what I
          can do. (Yes, automating it probably took longer than it would have
          taken me to do it the old-fashioned way – but it’s done now). When I
          write my log (or at least their rough drafts) I’m in a frenzy of
          problem solving – analysing my site and trying to figure things out.
        </p>
        <p>
          As far as web development goes, I’m still a complete novice. Most of
          what is do is a mix of playing around and researching things. If I
          document it all (let alone documented it semantically) I’d be here all
          day. I find it far more conductive to my flow if I just jot down a few
          notes and continue.
        </p>
        <p>
          But, back to what it was saying: adding the logs now would be a waste
          because I know the system is going to change.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3 class="dev-h">By WHY!?</h3>
        <p>
          Umm&hellip; depends. Doing the logs would be a waste because I already
          know better. I’d be saying something I believed at the time: but I now
          realize I was just blundering in my ignorance.
        </p>
        <p>
          This site is a bit like my dev-log. Some of it is here (and looking
          pretty good). Some of it was thrown here while I was fast asleep –
          hardly my best work but it’s passable. And some of it came from
          moments of blundering madness where I was desperately trying to get
          something to work.
        </p>
        <p>
          Just like my logs, I was so existed the lean more that the chore of
          restructuring this site into something more ‘sematic’ always felt like
          something I could put off.
        </p>
        <p>
          I’m well aware that this site of mine is an entanglement of failed
          ideas. Many of my choices are shaped my paradigms and systems far down
          the line. I seldom spend time on the structure if wat I was building –
          most of the time I was just happy to get things to work. Although I
          tried to be efficient and keep my scripts separate, they blead into
          each other ass certain functions turned out to be useful elsewhere.
        </p>
        <p>
          This doesn’t just go for my JavaScript (although that takes it to new
          extremes my CSS and html are the same. I have several SCC sheets
          scattered across the repo and I don’t really know which parts of each
          sheet are even in use. So much has changed and I just haven’t kept up
          with it.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3 class="dev-h">Why don't you just reorganise the repo?</h3>
        <p>
          I’m terrified of that. Like I said I’m not fully aware of where my
          dependencies are. Especially when it comes to CSS. I’m convinced that
          half my CSS code could be scrapped but the other half is critical to
          making sure that my pages don’t go crazy. Much like my JS: the CSS on
          the site is in a delicate balance where the loss of one seemingly
          insignificant class can make content fly off the page.
        </p>
        <p>
          The site has been a great leaning experience for me. I’ve messed
          around a lot, particularly with JS and I think I am a better developer
          for it but now I’m left with a mess. I honestly think it would be
          easier to start again with more knowledge than try and untangle and
          three-month old knot in just over two weeks.
        </p>
        <p>
          Besides, there is so much I have learned which I can put to good use
          next time.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3 class="dev-h">Consistent CSS repetition</h3>
        <p>
          I’ve done my best to be visually consistent. My site has a stye and
          colour pallet which I do may best to follow. I don’t look half bad,
          although some section could defiantly be improved. The issues come in
          I want to change something.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example: Replaced the [] around my headings with &lt;&gt; to help
          the user better understand that [this] is always a button while
          &lt;&gt; and // are merely decorative statice elements. If I had
          structured CSS properly, a task like this would only require a few
          lines of code to be changed. Ala, I had to sift through dozens of
          heading classes in multiple files. I have no clue why I made so many
          because for all intent and purposes most for my heading classes look
          the same (and this rule can be extended for most of my CSS). You seen
          [this] is consistently a button but a button is not consistently
          [this] because there are so many other button styles scarred across
          this repo.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3 class="dev-h">And what about he css itself?</h3>
        <p>
          As in the way I do things? Pretty messy. Lots of trail and error. It
          may look presentable but behind the scenes my site is very fragile.
          The basic layout used pixels because I was silly but transitioning
          from pixels to something else tends to create all kinds of layout
          anomalies. I’m also having some issues with the details, summary
          widgets which tended to be annoyingly resistant to text-wrapping and
          scaling. I could replace them with JS but the schematic value of them
          is vital: especially for screen reader users who deserve to know
          what’s going on.
        </p>
        <p>
          As for how it looks? The site is okay. But form the most of it still
          seems to be missing the spark that will make it look fantastic. I know
          that my current style has the potential: look at my individual games
          pages (for individual games). The blue and orange pop with vibrant
          contrast. The whole page feels sturdy and well made. The CSS there is
          relatively robust and aesthetically pleasing. I think that the
          including of more coloured blocks and images plays an important role
          in this too because it breaks the otherwise monolithic body of text.
        </p>
        <p>
          Compare may games pages to my blog: chalk and cheese. The blogs aren’t
          bad but something about them feels ‘meh’. They lack the innate energy
          and enthusiasm of the games pages. The games CSS is the most recent of
          my CSS code from last submission wile the blog CSS is some of the
          earliest. I think that shows. Fixing the blog has been a real struggle
          because I had no consistent way of doing things and had been throwing
          stuff at a wall to see what would stick. For the games I was in
          control.
        </p>
        <p>
          As untangling the old CSS becomes as daunting as restating (but with
          more annoying surprises along the way) I can’t help but think I would
          be better of taking new experience (and understanding of how my site’s
          aesthetic can work) to the older pages.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I restart, I need to layout consisted of nav communication rules
          BEFORE I begin styling. Otherwise, I get to the position I’m in now
          were there is too much to change. I also need to ensure more visual
          unity across my pages: other than heading and the colour scheme
          there’s not much they have in common which makes the site feel like a
          hodgepodge of contrasting ideas (which it kinda is).
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3 class="dev-h">And then there's HTML</h3>
        <p>
          Don’t even get me started on that. It was made to be static. Now it’s
          sort of dynamic. It a dinosaur with laser-beams and driving a
          spaceship made from twigs. Despite the ‘hands free’ automation
          potential of JS; my current site requires just as much finnicky set up
          as before.
        </p>
        <p>
          Why are there separate pages for each blog when I could just load in
          the content you ask? Because that’s how the links were structured (and
          because I don’t want to lose my meta data). Good semantics and static
          html links are in direct conflict with good automation. They don’t
          have to be. But they are because of how my system was made. The
          general html structure requires a lot of housekeeping because it was
          never built with standardized automation in mind. Tis leads to
          inefficient and JS that can’t be reused in other sections without
          massive reworks.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yes, I have sematic markup – but it’s of little use to me because it’s
          not consistent mark up. I have a bunch of wrapper and containers I
          don’t even need and even now a plethora of repeated code. As I lean
          more about JS and the shadow DOM I see how I could make things way
          better. But I’d need to build from the ground up. There is no point in
          building a sky-scraper on a heap of mud.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was just talking up my games pages: but they are a prime example of
          the problem. They remain totally unscalable. While I like how they
          look they are missing the navigation tab that allows users to pick
          other articles from the blogs section.
        </p>
        <p>
          Don’t even get me started on the index/about section which was once
          the hub of my entire site. Now it’s a bunch of headings that the users
          scroll though aimlessly. Look, it’s not bad. It continues the flow of
          the original scrolling, looks cool and hopefully impresses the user.
          But it also feels a bit weird and pointless. I wanted it to feel like
          I was introducing the user to my site and giving them a tour of what
          was to come. I think the though behind this I good, but it could be
          better executed with a page built with that idea in mind.
        </p>
        <p>
          HTML is the selection of a website: I can’t make an eagle with the
          skeleton of a donkey. You know the common theme by now: I may as well
          just restart.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3 class="dev-h">But there is a silver lining</h3>
        <p>
          This has been a great learning experience. My knowledge is scrawled
          down on scrap paper and word documents. And as tedious as putting that
          into a sematic structure may be, it’s a task that much be done. There
          comes a time when this site stops being a playground and an experiment
          and statis being a professional portfolio. As someone who plants to
          have a future in software development the code IS my portfolio. This
          dev-log and all that I do in it is just as important as my games
          section. The games show surface level what: but here we have the how
          and why. And those are way more valuable.
        </p>
        <p>
          But if the log and the site are just an experimental mess, what does
          that say about me. Yes I am leaning, but it’s also my duty (in the
          context of this site) to show of what I have learnt in the best way
          possible.
        </p>
        <p>
          A new site will be built to be better than the old one because the JS
          under the hood will be catered for from day one. A car is better than
          a cart with a motorised horse.
        </p>
        <p>
          With my knowledge of what is possible with JS and how to do it I’ll be
          able to think more critically about why I am doing and how that will
          impact my system. (I did do that, but it was hard to do because the
          full extent of the system only became apparent later).
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3 class="dev-h">I will be able to take a lot across</h3>
        <p>
          Make no mistake. This reboot is not a reset. Thanks to good markup and
          my data loading capacities I will be able to load most of my old
          content onto my new site as is. That’s why wanted automation in the
          first place-content is not bound to how it is presented. Once I refine
          the navigation, CSS and general structure I will be able to use my
          [refined] JS frameworks to their full potential. (I’d love to be able
          to add one JS script to each doc and not 500).
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3 class="dev-h">Moving fromward</h3>
        <p>
          My HTML templates are working well and the
          <code class="inline">load-href</code>formatting system has allowed be
          to bypass the constrains of relative referencing and pull information
          everywhere. This gives me a great opportunity to build a modular
          website using encapsulation. I will be able to make myself a set of
          building block which I can then use to build the site without the
          tedium of repeated semantic structure. (Remember I can have templates
          in templates).
        </p>
        <p>
          In my new site I won’t be building with html alone. I will use the
          tools I have to make better tools (while being critical of their
          implications). And surly better tools will make a better site.
        </p>
        <p>
          I’m also going to change how I build this site. The new site is not
          going to be a workshop of tinkering and experimentation. (I’m still
          going to tinker but not there.) But just as this article will need to
          be reformatted to go into the dev-log for public consumption my
          tinkering needs to be reformatted to go onto my site.f
        </p>
        <p>
          My final website will be the professional, structure interface
          (logically organised directories). With my exam submission only two
          weeks away I think I will stop thinking about what else I can write on
          scrap paper and start thinking about how to format it exceptionally.
          Honestly, I should have done this far sooner: but better late than
          never. (My lost dev-log entries agree.)
        </p>
        <p>
          I’ve ranted enough now. Yes, this site is a mess. But most workshops
          are: at least the interesting ones. The mess just means I’ve been
          refining my craft. But enough offcuts and sawdust: it’s time to craft
          my first polished work. It’s all well and god to play around – but I
          is time for me to devote what I learn from tinkering into disciplined
          development
