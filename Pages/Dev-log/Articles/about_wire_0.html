        A brief look at the layout of the About section. this section will be

          <h3 class="dev-h">Why put the About section next?</h3>
          <p>
            I don't know how long a visitor will scroll so it's important I get
            to the point. Once have show them a bit of what I do (in the home
            navigation section) I should tell them who I am. The point of the
            site is to market myself so I should get to the product (me) as soon
            as possible.
          </p>
          <p>
            This part should be short an to the point so that the visitor feels
            it will not take too long to read.
          </p>
          <p>
            It will make extensive use of collapsible inline text so that if the
            viewer wants to read more they can, without the section feeling too
            long or wordy. This also allows vistor to interact with the site,
            deliveing a more engaging and intresting experance.
          </p>
          <p>
            I don't want to come off as pretentiously formal so this will be a
            bit tongue in cheek. As much as I want to seem qualified, I also
            want to sound interesting.

          <img
            class="log-img big"
            id="about_wire_frmae"
            src="Wire-frames/home-nav-img.png"
            alt="A wire frame for the about section with a profile picture and persolnal details on the left and details about me on the right."
          /><br />
          <label for="about_wire_frmae" class="log-label">
            wireframe for the About section
          </label>
          <br />
          <ul>
            <li>
              Text offset to the right to balance the left-aligned heading. This
              will make the section layout appear more interesting and less
              text-heavy. I assume that this will lead the viewer eyes downwards
              diagonally. Their eyes will then move from the title to the
              profile picture and then to the text. They will then move back and
              read the contact information.
            </li>
            <li>
              Profile pic is in the top left so that the introduction feels
              personal and the visitor can put a face to my name.
            </li>
            <li>
              Contact icons (for social media etc) will appear at the top left.
              In this position they are easily visible but do not feel like
              obnoxious clutter. These icons encourage the visitor to reach out
              to me (which is exactly what I want them to do).

          <h3 class="dev-h">Some notes after coding the About section</h3>
          <p>
            Gosh this is awful! Nothing behaves How I want it to. I used the
            &lt;section&gt; and &lt;details&gt; widget to make the popout more
            accessible- but they don't stay I one line. When they are opened
            they fly to the bottom of the page for some reason which looks
            awful.
          </p>
          <p>
            Perhaps I can make these work better with JavaScript later on but
            for now they feel like a janky wase of time.

          <p>
            The widget was clearly intened to be used for text-blocks rather
            than inline elements and it shows here. I'm also worried that users
            might think that it is a hyperlink and not click on it.
          </p>
          <p>
            I want this feature in on my site. It is interesting and exciting.
            But it's currently a pain to setup becuse the widget has so many
            sections. It doesn't even look as good I would like I will come back
            and figure this out later; if and when time permits. Right now I
            need to focus on constructing the rest of the site.
