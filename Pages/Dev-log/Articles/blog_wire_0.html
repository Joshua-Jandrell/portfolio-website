      <p>How should the blog section and blog posts be structured?</p>
      <p>
        Games will be followed by a blog section. Visitor's know what I do but
        now they get to see who I am. The blogs should feel conversational and
        I'll try to make them a bit humorous.

        <h3 class="dev-h">Why should the blogs be informal?</h3>
        <p>
          I want to give the impression that the blogs are not censored or
          formalised. Using casual language like contraction shows that that the
          blogs aren't meant to be overly academic or formal. The deformalized
          context makes them feel more genuine. This section gives visitors an
          idea of who I am and how I think. I'm not going to give any false
          pretences.
        </p>
        <p>
          That said, I'm also not going to be an idol. This is the internet:
          putting too much of myself out there is dangerous and might come to
          bite me. I need to set boundary. I won't share everything or pour my
          heart out. I'll give my genuine opinions, but not all my opinions.
          I'll avoid swearing (event though everyone f@king does it) and try not
          to make and radically contentious claims. I must bare in mind that I
          am a brand and I can't bring my future employer's name into disrepute.
        </p>
        <p>
          I know this approach is a bit of a cop-out. Perhaps as I get more
          confident about being online I'll get bolder. This is still quite
          scary for me: I don't even use social media.

            alt="An image of the blog section wireframe"
          /><br />
          <label for="#blog_wire_frame-img" class="log-label">

        <p>
          Recent blogs are most prominent, displayed in large blocks to the left
          - a natural starting point for the English-reader's eye. New work
          emphasised here because it is likely better and more topical. A short
          blurb is porvided for each post to get the visitor interested to read
          more.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is a list of all blogs is placed in a scroll space to the right
          for easy reference. This shows viewer there is more to read if they
          want. As the blog gets bigger I might sort blog entries into lists
          based on category and have a more comprehensive display of blogs on a
          seperate page. I may also add a search feature in further. For now
          this should be fine.
        </p>
        <p>
          Splash text (will eventually be randomised) is placed below the blog
          title. This sets a conversational tone and makes things fun. Blog
          section should feel friendly and inviting.

          Blog index gives can get a sense of the article structure. This is
          particularly helpful for screen reader users.
        </p>
        <p>
          Back button next to title, allows the user to return to main blog
          section if they wish (can be tweaked to send them to previous paged
          using JS later).
        </p>
        <p>
          The related blog sections are included to enrage the visitor to keep
          reading. They are paced on the side and agian at the bottom. The
          bottom ones will be in the same preview format that is used on the
          homepage. when the reader reaches the bottom of the page they are
          finished with the blog - sample posts should help to get them
          interested in something else.
        </p>
        <p>
          Share icons will allow the user to share the url over their social
          media. The url for this can be generated from the following site:
          <a
            href="https://www.sharelinkgenerator.com/"
            target="_blank"
            class="inline-link"
            rel="external"
            >Share Link Generator: Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Pinterest, and
            Email mailto forms.</a
          >
          This is super useful!

        <p>
          Removed the right-hand related articles tab: this was redundant
          clutter. The reader will only need to look for more to read when they
          are finished reading (at the end of the page) If I want to refer to
          another article during the blog I can do so with a hyperlink.
        </p>
        <p>
          The footer section of the blog is stylistically distinct so that the
          reader can clearly see they have finished reading.
