        Square brackets have been a recurring motif on my sight because they

            pretty images and fancy graphics. Of course, this is by design - but
            having no decoration at all is boring. The brackets add a bit of
            intrigue and variety while acting as a motif. They give the site a
            distinct aesthetic style with should make it more memorable to
            visitors. Furthermore, it ensures that all pages on the site (I
            know, this sounds like a horribly mixed metaphor…) are look like
            parts of a common whole; even when their layout and content is
            varied.

            So? Why not are semi colons, ampersands, or OTHER BRACKETS - these
            are used in code too!
          </p>
          <p>Well, yes. But square ones are the best! (In my case anyway).</p>
          <p>
            Firstly, square brackets are often used for indexing in programming
            languages. And this is how I am using brackets on my site. They
            indicate tilts and section: items that would appear in and index. If
            my site were some sort of dictionary class, this is exactly how a
            under might expect to retrieve the section associated with a title.
            Tying a functional meaning to the elements is important because it
            reinforces the connection to programming (and shows that I know what
            I'm doing).
          </p>
          <p>
            Other coding syntax elements lack his meaning. Semi-colons are just
            line endings and curly brackets often just contain sections of code.
            (As for good old round brackets, their meaning is already well
            defined as an element of English punctuation. Not not just
            meaningless, they're but confusing too!)
          </p>
          <p>
            I also like square brackets because they appear strong and
            confident. Most containers on this site have crisp, sharp boarders
            with unrounded edges - square braces fit comfortably into this
            astatic. (Although I must confess square braces may have also
            informed this athletic)
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3 class="dev-h">So what's wrong with them?</h3>
          Look at these two random containers:
          <article class="demo-square-bracket-divs">
            <div class="square-bracket-bad">
              [<span class="inner">Something in brackets</span>]
            </div>
            <div class="square-bracket-good">Something in brackets</div>
          </article>
          <p class="retoric" aria-roledescription="retoric">
            Is this a trick or something?Ones one is on top the other is on the
            bottom?
          </p>
          <p>
            If you are viewing this site on a monitor, they probably look the
            same. But if you view them with a screen reader one is haven then
            the other is hell. (And not becuase of that top and bottom thing.)
          </p>
          <p class="retoric" aria-roledescription="retoric">
            Is this a trick or something?Ones one is on top the other is on the
            bottom?
          </p>
          <p>
            Open square bracket imagine close square bracket if I spoke like
            open square brace this close square brace.
          </p>

          <p class="retoric" aria-roledescription="retoric">
            I can't even understand what you are saying.
          </p>
          <p>
            Exactly! That's what happens if <em>decorative</em> square brackets
            are added as inline characters. Like I did with the first div (and
            most of the early headers on this site).
          </p>
          <p>Take a look at the code for the first one to see what I mean:</p>
          <pre>
              <code class="code-sinp">
&ltstyle&gt
.square-bracket-bad {
font-weight: bold;
color: rgb(47, 177, 203);
}
.square-bracket-bad .inner {
font-weight: normal;
color: black;
margin: 0 10px;
}
&lt/style&gt

&ltdiv class="square-bracket-bad"&gt
[&ltspan class="inner"&gtSomething in brackets&lt/span&gt]
&lt/div&gt
              </code>
            </pre>

          <p class="retoric" aria-roledescription="retoric">
            Oh dear. That's a bummer... I'm guessing the second div is
            different...
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3 class="sub-h">How do you fix this></h3>
          <p>
            Magic.
            <span class="inline-comment"
              >(Actually CSS, which is basically the same thing.)</span
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            I made used of the ::before and ::after CSS pseudo elements. These
            elements render (you'll never guess this) before and after their
            parent element. Think of them like the bullet points on a list. They
            are pretty neat and simple to use.
          </p>
          <p>Just look at the code for the lower div:</p>
          <pre>
              <code class="code-sinp">
&ltstyle&gt
.square-bracket-good {
font-weight: normal;
color: black;
}
.square-bracket-good::before {
content: "[";
font-weight: bold;
color: rgb(47, 177, 203);
margin-right: 10px;
}
.square-bracket-good::after {
content: "]";
font-weight: bold;
color: rgb(47, 177, 203);
margin-left: 10px;
}
&lt/style&gt

&ltdiv class="square-bracket-good"&gtSomething in brackets&lt/div&gt
              </code>
            </pre>
          <p>
            Did you notice the lack of braces? Well screen reader users noticed
            that too! So did web crawlers and anything else that is interfacing
            directly with the code on my site. Removing square brackets and
            other decretive clutter makes the code more sematic and machine
            readable.
          </p>
          <p>
            Pseudo elements aren't real. They can't hurt you. (Pseudo literally
            means fake!) These elements are defined entirely with scc styling
            which means that, like all good children in the Middle Ages, they
            can be seen but not heard.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another great thing about the pseudo element approach is the
            flexibility it gives me. Let's say I get hooked on C++ and decide
            that titles aren't really indexes _ there're pointers. So, I want to
            change all of the []'s into *'s. If I need to change the characters
            next to every single heading, I'd probably give up or pass out from
            boredom. Fortunately, with pseudo elements this is as simple as
            changing two lines of CSS . If the style s applied to a class, this
            can allow innumerable html elements to be reformatted.
          </p>
          <p>
            Done! Now I must go get rid of all those legacy brackets on my site.
            (Or write a program to do it for me). Wish me luck!
