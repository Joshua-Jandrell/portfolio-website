      The back button was never well placed on my wireframes and has always felt
      like an award appendage cluttering up the site. I'm still not 100% sure
      where to put it, but at least I've thought things through.</span

        <h3 class="dev-h">What doess the back button do?</h3>
        The back button allows the user to go back to where they game from. I'm
        renaming it the return button because the fits the “programming” theme
        better. (Return is the command given to leave a function).

        <h3 class="dev-h">What's the issue with it?</h3>
        <p>
          The back buttons on the blog and dev-log pages are a bit of a mess.
          They float around haphazardly feeling like clutter wherever they go.
        </p>
        <p>
          I've moved most navigation and index features to the right, which is
          great, but it means that there is even less space for the button to
          naturally rest.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was considering putting it on the nav bar - but I want the nave bar
          to have the same fields throughout the site to give a sense of
          consistency. The nav-bar is also quite cluttered as it is.
        </p>
        <p class="retoric" aria-roledescription="retoric">
          Can't the user just navigate with the nav bar? Why is return so
          important?
        </p>
        <p>
          Currently it's not doing that much. But once I start adding some JS
          the return button will send the user back to their previous page,
          wherever that was. This makes navigating the site easier (which is
          never a bad thing). So, no. No, I do not want to do away with the
          return button.
        </p>
        <p>
          To be honest I'm not sure where it should go. I could throw it onto
          the right-hand side, but it would look weird and lonely there.
          Besides, the website is in English which sets a natural left-to right
          convention. Returning or going back can be seen as leftwards movement,
          so putting a return button on the right may seem unintuitive.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm going to be reformatting it to look like a piece of code and throw
          it under the title. I'll pop it again at the bottom of the article.
          Logically these are the two points where a reader is most likely to
          decide they want to go back. Either they haven't started and decide
          they'd rather look at something else, or they finished reading and
          want to go back.
        </p>

        <p>
          With this in mind I'll probably be floating a return button above the
          index section and again at the bottom of the article. Being above the
          index will put the button in the comfortable top left corner - where
          one expects a back button to be. The one at the bottom of the page
          let's users return when they are finished reading. Is this overkill?
          Perhaps a back at the end is goo enough. Is there a point in asking
          someone to leave when they just arrived?
        </p>

      <p>
        Possibly. I'll have to wait and see. I think I'll throw it in at below
        the index (at least for now). This groups it with navigation which seems
        logical. The dev-log index is quite long so I'll put a return button at
        the bottom and one at the top so that the vistor always has one on
        screen. I can always re-move these buttons later&hellip;
