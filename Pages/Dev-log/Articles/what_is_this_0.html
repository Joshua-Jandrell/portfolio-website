          <h3 class="dev-h">Oh gosh - I hate self promotion</h3>
          <p>
            A quick note before we begin. I am a firm believer of the age old
            writing rule: “show don't tell” (Kinda ironic that I'm telling you
            this).
          </p>
          <p>
            I find that claiming to be good at something is about as meaningful
            as measuring the weigh of a box by looking at it. Terms like 'good';
            'great'; 'excellent' and 'horrible' are all relative. Everyone has
            their own personal standard and then we get the Dunning-Kruger
            effect. Sure you can have something measurable like experience of
            qualification - but that alone doesn't necessarily imply meticulous
            craft, personal growth and artistic flare.
          </p>
          <p>
            The best way to convince someone I have the skills they want is to
            show them what I can do. Fortunately a portfolio is designed to do
            just that - yay!
          </p>
          <p>
            Unfortunate, when designing the portfolio I have to try and
            emphasise what I am good at and trick people into thinking it. In
            some cases I might need to claim that I am 'good' at things -
            without proving anything. I know it can be cringy worthy and I'll be
            cringing with you. But self-promotion is the aim of this game
            (actually it's a website) and I'd show myself to be a pretty poor
            designer if my system didn't do that.

        <section id="what_is_this_2">
          <h3 class="dev-h">What am I doing with this website?</h3>
          <p>
            It is a portfolio website. So its primary purpose is to sell a
            product and that product is me.
          </p>
          <p>
            This website will hold my portfolio as a game designer - but also as
            a critical and systems thinker. As a designer I tend to focus more
            on technical implementation and system design than art and
            animation. The website needs to highlight these strengths and
            convince the visitor that they need my services.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am fortunate because the skills I wish to convey are deeply linked
            to web-development. If this website delivers a smooth system and a
            good user experience, then the site itself becomes the portfolio.

          <h3 class="dev-h">Who is me and why do you want him?</h3>
          <p>
            Anyone visiting a portfolio website is aware that the purpose of the
            site is to impress them. The expect to see me standing in a suit and
            tie to show them my best-polished brass.
          </p>
          <p>
            Trying to impress people is not very impressive. I could be a clean
            cut cooperate coder, but I might also come of as a sleazy snake-oil
            salesman. One is dubious, and frankly the other is quite boring.
          </p>
          <p>
            I don't want my website to feel pretentiously professional, nor do I
            want it to feel like a self-pitch. I want to give it a casual vibe.
            I want visitors to see that I am passionate about what I am doing
            and feel that I am sharing that passion with them. I want them to
            think of this website as a dialog rather than a business pitch, a
            sharing ideas rather than an exhibition. Hopefully this will feel
            more genuine and make me seem like a creative and interesting human,
            rather than just another cut-out candidate.
          </p>
          <p>
            As an engineer-to be (if all goes according to my current plans) I
            have a creative edge over most technical graduates. I would have
            competed several humanities focused courses and engaged more deeply
            with the artistic and philosophical aspects of technology. Making
            games provides great incites into UX, UI and human centerer systems.
            These are useful and transferable skills when it comes to systems
            design an implantation.
          </p>
          <p>
            As an artist and designer the convers is true. I would have a
            professional technical degree.
          </p>
          <p class="imp">Technical creatively is my unique selling point.</p>
          <p>
            But what sets me apart form other people who have the same
            qualification as me? My meness. I like to think that I am driven and
            strive for excellence yet remain playful and love my work. (I do
            tend to overthinking, I'm a victim to over scoping, perfection
            paralysis, rambling and going off on tangents from my tangents - but
            that's me too.) I want the site to reflect that duality.
            Professional, yet playful. Clear yet creative. (Prone to random
            tangents and probably quite extra; yet well oiled and reliable when
            it matters).
          </p>
          <p class="retoric" aria-roledescription="retoric">
            So you've waffled about yourself but what about your site?
          </p>
          <p>
            Simple. The site just needs to reflect everything I just said. And
            now the question is how.
          </p>
          <p>
            P.S. I don't just want the wesite to 'feel' casual, realaxed and
            honest. Smart people can see throught that. I want it to truly be
            this way. As much as it IS a portfolio website and its unavoidable
            primary focus is to showcase my work to potential employers, it can
            also be a place for me to share my work with colleagues and friends.
            If I'm honest, I'd love it to be the latter. Giving it elements of
            the later says more about me than any essey ever could.
