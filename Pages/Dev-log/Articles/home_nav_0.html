      The home section will be dedicated to showcasing featured articles on my
      site. This could be my newest blog entry or a recently made game. This
      will be the first section on the index page and the point that all 'home'
      links redirect to. That 'hello world' thing is nice and all but it would
      be a pain to have to scroll though every time.</span

        <h3 class="dev-h">So how will this all work?</h3>
        <p>
          Naturally these will be a selection of articles which I think are
          great and that I want the visitor to read. If the visitor want's to
          look at my work this is a great think to point them to my best work
          without putting it on a pedestal. (I mean it kinda is on a pedestal -
          but it's a gentle nudge rather than a violent push.)
        </p>
        <p>
          This isn't really about navigation: it's about showing the visitor
          that I'm busy with a bunch of interesting projects. This enforces the
          idea that they should continue exploring the site because it has a lot
          to offer. It also makes me look engaged and interesting as a designer.
        </p>
        <p>
          If a particular article catches the visitors attention, it will open
          in a new tab. This encourages them to return to the home page and keep
          exploring.
        </p>
        <p>
          The caption 'explore' is a call to action which should encourage
          victors to follow the links.

        <h3 class="dev-h">How will this be structured?</h3>
        <img
          class="log-img big"
          id="home_nav_wire_frmae"
          load-src="Pages/Dev-log/Wire-frames/home-nav-img.png"
          alt="A wire frame fo the home navigation section. 4 sample articles are displayed in a grid"
        /><br />
        <label for="home_nav_wire_frmae" class="log-label">
          wireframe for naviation section.
        </label>
        <p>
          This will be a simple grid. A gird layout is less hierarchal than a
          stacked list and gives the impression of variety and organisation.
          Grid provide strcture and order which make the site appeare well
          constructed and solidly put togerther.
        </p>
        <p>
          The articles will be represented by large icons to make clicking easy.
          Each article will have a short preview to create intrigue. The layout
          is simple and minimal so that the visitor can take the site in without
          feeling overwhelmed.
