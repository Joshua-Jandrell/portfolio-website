      This site has undergone quite a few stylistic changes during development,
      but it's been finalised now. Here is the official style guid.</span

        <h3 class="dev-h">Aesthetic</h3>
        <p>
          I am primarily a systems designer be that games, engineering, or
          programming. Art and graphics are not my forte; thus, I will not be
          using illustrations and images as the focal point of the site. The
          site itself is the artefact of most importance to my future employers:
          if I cannot make a good website how could their trust me to construct
          their system.
        </p>
        <p>
          A sleek minimal athletic is used to make the site feel focused,
          polished, and professional. This will showcase the site as a system
          rather than a piece of visual art.
        </p>
        <p>
          Solid lines and square boxes (without rounded edges) will be used to
          provide a sense of order and structure. Solid boxes appear trustworthy
          and confident. This should make visitors feel that the site is well
          constructed, well organised, and reliable.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3 class="dev-h">Tone</h3>
        <p>
          Although the sites construction appears to be formal the site itself
          should not be. It is important that I still come across as a creative,
          energetic, and artistic individual because these are strengths of mine
          too. The site cannot be too business-like. It should feel fun and
          interesting rather than a soulless repository of work for future
          employers. This can be achieved with a causal writing style, the use
          of contraction and slang and a conversational tone.

        <h3 class="dev-h">Colour pallet</h3>
        <article>
          <img
            class="log-img big"
            id="dev_wire_frame-img"
            src="./Wire-frames/contact-wire-img.png"
            load-src="./Pages/Dev-log/Wire-frames/Palett.png"
            alt="Colores used on this site: white, orange, dark cyan and balck"
          />
        </article>
        <p>
          The predominant colour of the site is white. White as a background
          colour will make the site feel clean and unclutters. This helps to
          create a sense of minimalism and clarity. This Black text on a white
          background feels natural and is easy to read - delivering simple and
          comfortable experience is important because it makes the system appear
          to be of a higher quality.
        </p>
        <p>
          Orange is used for decorative elements and highlights. Orange is
          bright and ethicistic. It suggests energy and excitement which helps
          to convey the more fun-loving site to myself and my website. Orange is
          also often use to enrage actions such as purchases and is assisted
          with value. Being seen as valuable or a 'good deal' is useful when
          trying to sell oneself.
        </p>
        <p>
          Light blue is used as a secondary highlight colour. Blue is seen as
          relaxed, reliable, and thoughtful. The light blue helps to create a
          casual atmosphere in conjunction with the orange.
        </p>
        <p>
          Blue and orange are contrasting colours and thus appear stringer and
          brighter when used together. Their combination gives a sense of
          balance, organisation and harmony. This represents a well-tuned site
          and my personality, with a balance of creativity (orange) and
          technical capability (blue).
        </p>
        <p>
          The bright colour platelet gives the site a vibrant presence and a
          playful energy, but it might lack presence if it were not anchored
          with a darker tone. Addressing a third hue might make the site feel to
          busy and could cause the contrasting blue and orange to clash with
          each other. Thus, black is used to maintain a simple palette and a
          minimal aesthetic.
        </p>

      <section>
        <h3 class="dev-h">Font types and decoration</h3>
        <p>
          Monospace will be used for headings. Monospace is often used in
          programming and technical applications. It is ideal to suggest to the
          viewer that I work in this space and write code. Headings are
          decorated with double forward slashes and square brackets (simple
          symbols often used while programming) to enhance this effect.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is important that visitors feel comfortable on the site and find it
          easy to engage with articles. Arial is used for the main body text.
          This font is familiar and easy to read. As a sans-serif, Arial is
          modern and less informal (without being unprofessional). This augments
          the well-made but playful appearance of the site.
