        Each game will have a short article written about it to provide more
        information about what's going on before the visitor starts playing.
        This context will help them understand what the game is trying to
        do.</span

          A short description about the game is very important because many of
          my games were made with limited time and I wasn't able to do
          everything I wanted. I need to explain what I was trying to do and
          what I was able to do. I will try keep this frank, breif and to the
          point so that visitors can get on with playing. This section is placed
          above the download section to encourage the viewer to read about my
          game first and understand the context before they play it.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, the download section should be prominent and distinctly
          formatted; making easy for one to download and play the game. That's
          what they are here for after all.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is followed by a credits section. Giving credits to myself and
          acknowledging the contribution of others is simply good practice -
          especially on a portfolio site. This may also allow me to link to my
          colleagues' websites in the future which is pretty cool!
        </p>
        <p>
          Back button encourages the viewer to easily return to the homepage and
          engage with more content.
        </p>
        <p>
          Share and feedback buttons are to encourage further engagement. I'd
          love my games to get exposure or learn how I could improve If the
          viewer does either its very beneficial to me. These are at the bottom
          because I assume most users would like to experience the content
          before they wish to talk about it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Images of gameplay will be placed down the right-hand side to give the
          visitor a preview of what's in the game without being intrusive or
          distracting. I considered videos but I'd rather people played my games
          to experience them for themselves.
