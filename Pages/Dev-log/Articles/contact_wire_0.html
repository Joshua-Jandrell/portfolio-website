          Clickable icons makes it quick and easy for visitors to contact me.
          They can do it with a single mouse click rather than having to open up
          their mail app and paste in an address. The structure is simple and to
          the point - contacting me should be easy and effortless so I'd like to
          avoid clutter.
        </p>
        <p>
          WhatsApp and telegram icons will allow visitors to send me messages. I
          will not display phone number because I want people to email or
          message me, rather than calling.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'll pop in a link to my git-hub (even though most of my repos are
          private at this stage). This is where most of my game code is kept so
          it makes sent to give curios visitors a chance to take a look.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm planning to make an itch account some time soon, so I'll set up a
          link from that in when its ready.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are some linkes to prominent sigts missing. I have a couple
          work-related YouTube videos but they aren't very relevant and I don't
          upload often. I do not have linked in, twitter or face book (yet) - so
          no point in linking there. My Instagram and Pinterest accounts aren't
          applicable (and aren't in use much anyway).
        </p>
        <p>
          I think I will add a small contact section at the bottom of blog pages
          too. Just to make it more conveneinet to give me feedback.

        <p>
          Of course all of the logos I am using are official downloads and I am
          following each companies logo guidelines.
        </p>
        <p>
          I want to include the WhatsApp logo. But the official logos are awful.
          They all float on a giant off-white back ground so when they are next
          to the logos of respectable companies they look tiny.
        </p>
        <p>
          It's a pity: but it is what it isâ€¦ (I've removed the background from
          one and cropped it . I believe this does not go against the logo use
          agreement because I haven't modified the logo itself and I've left the
          required whitespace around it.
        </p>
        <p>
          It's not my business - but this stuff matters! Surly meta want me to
          send traffic to their platform? Shouldn't they make it easy to use
          their logo instead of a pain? (I used it anyway so maybe not.)
