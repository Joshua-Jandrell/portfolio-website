        <p>Time for another reboot!</p>
        <p>
          ... Well sort of. This time it's a soft reboot. I won't be
          re-desinging the whole site or anythting. I just need to fix my
          <a
            load-href="Pages/Blog/Pages/ux-ui.html"
            class="inline-link"

        <h3 class="dev-h">What exactly does this entail?</h3>
        <p>
          The current nav system isn’t quite working. So I’ll be redesigning the
          nav bar and links in general. I’ll also be re-working the layout of
          the site and adding designated blog and games pages. I then need to go
          through my existing pages and make the more user friendly becuase it
          turns out they aren't as great as I think.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally I’ll throw in a pinch of javascript to make things come alive.
          (I kinda also want to automate things and dynamaically load JS
          content. But, working this out is part of the reson I've been away so
          we will see if I get round to it. The trade-off between convenicane
          and performance is important to keep in mind.)

          Liar! You gonna strat with JS first. Arn't you?&hellip;?

          You know me too well. Season two has started and it's time to get
          side-tracked...
