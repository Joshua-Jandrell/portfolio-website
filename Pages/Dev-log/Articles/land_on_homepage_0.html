      Taking a look at how a visitor may navigate though the site and finding

        <h3 class="dev-h">What is important about the homepage?</h3>
        <p>
          The homepage has to make a good impression. It is likely the first
          (and possibly only) thing with visitors to my site will see.
        </p>
        <p>
          It needs to amaze them, interest them and make them want to see more!
          I may not have long to get a visitators attention. Visors must be
          enthralled but they should be able to immediately know what I do when
          they glace at my webpage.
        </p>
        <p class="retoric" aria-roledescription="retoric">
          How will you do this?
        </p>
        <p>I have a couple tricks up my sleeve&hellip;</p>
      </section>
      <section id="land_on_homepage_2">
        <h3 class="dev-h">'Hello World.'</h3>
        <p>
          That will be the first message visitors see when they land on my site.
          I know it's quite cliched, however it says a lot. When learning to
          program in a new language, printing 'hello world' is one of the first
          programs one writes. Opening with 'hello world' immediately tells the
          visitor - 'Hey I'm a programmer. I made this.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Hellow World" is also a greeting to the world. I'm acknowledging that
          I have just gone live on the internet for the first time. And that's
          pretty cool! This grounds also grounds me: it acknowledges that I have
          just begun my journey as a developer and still need to lean and grow
          while alos commemerating that fact that I am live on the wrold wide
          web.
        </p>
        <p>
          The visitor is just greeted by a back screen with 'Hello world' on it.
          It should feel like the command consol. Empty and blank. A monospace
          font is used to enhance this effect.
        </p>
        <img
          class="log-img"
          id="land_on_homepage_0-img0"
          load-src="Pages/Dev-log/Land_on_site-images/Hello-world-only.png"
          alt="A black screen with 'hello world' printed in the center"
        /><br />
        <label for="#land_on_homepage_0-img0" class="log-label">
          What visitors see when arrving.
        </label>
        <p class="retoric" aria-roledescription="retoric">And then what?</p>
        <img
          class="log-img"
          id="land_on_homepage_0-img1"
          load-src="Pages/Dev-log/Land_on_site-images/Hello-world-revield.png"
          alt="More text appears as the user keeps scrolling"
        /><br />
        <label for="land_on_homepage_0-img1" class="log-label">
          Text emerges from the darkness.
        </label>
        <p>
          They then scroll down and the site is revealed. The emergence of a
          bright and polished sight should have a significant impact. Everything
          will look brighter and slicker in contrast to the first back screen.
          This is to make and impactful first impression and convey the idea of
          personal growth.
        </p>
        <p>A rounded san-serif font will be used to enhance this contrast.</p>

      <section id="land_on_homepage_3">
        <h3 class="deh-h">Just Keep Scrowling</h3>
        <p>
          As the visitor scrolls they unveil the site. In due course JavaScript
          will help me make this experience feel exciting and polished. This
          will transform the mundane act of scrolling down a webpage into an
          adventure. As the viewer scrolls down the site they become curios to
          see how things will change and what will come next. While scrolling, I
          introduce myself and I invite the visitor to look around the site. I
          don't necessarily expect them to follow my prompts. I just want them
          to keep scrolling.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once hey have started so they'll probably continue. I don't expect
          victors to explore my whole site (even if I would like them to)
          they'll probably just look at the homepage. Following hyperlinks
          implies distance and travel. The visitor has so many option to chose
          from an chose nothing as a result.
        </p>
        <p>
          But what is the whole site is a homepage? If the about, blogs, game
          and so on are all on my home page already then the visitor will feel
          there is more to explore. They won't have got to the bottom and this
          incompleteness if powerful. When I add JS to the site I will turn the
          top navigation bar into a progress bar to sell the effect even more.
        </p>
        <p>
          By the time a visitor scrolls to the bottom they will have seen the
          overview I wanted to give them.
        </p>

      <section>
        <h3 class="dev-h">A quick not on accessibility</h3>
        <p>
          reveal. The nav bar is not the first thing that visitors see. They see
          'Hello World'. Screen reader users should be afforded the same
          experience. A screen reader reads from top to bottom and the page is
          designed with that in mind. When landing on the index page a screen
          reader should say “Hello World” and not “navigation, nav-bar”. This
          concept should be kept in mind throughout the coding of this site.
