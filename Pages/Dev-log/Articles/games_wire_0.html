      This is my portfolio section and will be below About in the Index. Once I
      have introduced myself to visitors I should show them what I like to do. I
      want this section to feel like I'm sharing a passion rather than
      exhibiting work.</span

          Why do you have a games section on a portfolio website?
        </h3>
        <p>
          The section is called games, rather than portfolio. This makes it
          sound less like an exhibition of carefully selected work and more like
          and informal showcase things I want to share.
        </p>
        <p class="retoric" aria-roledescription="retoric">
          What's the difference?
        </p>
        <p>
          One is trying to impress, the other is trying to enthuse. One is
          formal and passive, the other is clear and confident. I want to come
          across and enthusiastic and passionate because that will reflect that
          I would make and diligent and motivated employee.
        </p>
        <p>
          This also means that 'games' is displayed on the nav-bar allowing
          visitors to quicky surmise that I make games when they land on the
          site - there is not question about what work I do.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm not just a game designer, I do other things too.Perhaps in time
          I'll add a portfolio of more technical work too. If this is the case
          separate sections are logical because, employers from different fields
          would be interested in different things.

        <h3 class="dev-h">How will the section be structured?</h3>

        <img
          class="log-img big"
          id="games_wire_frame-img"
          src="Wire-frames/games-wire-img.png"
          alt="A wirefram for the games section - games icons are all placed in a large 3 by 2 centered grid."
        /><br />
        <label for="#games_wire_frame-img" class="log-label">
          Wireframe for Games section.
        </label>
        <p>
          This is similar to the Home/'explore' section. The grid makes the site
          feel well constructed. The grid is also reminiscent of game
          applications on a desktop or smartphone making the presentation
          familiar to users. They should easily understand that clicking on the
          game will open it (or open a page about it).
        </p>
        <p>
          Games will predominantly be represented by pictures. Reading is a
          laborious while pictures are fun and require less effort. This makes
          the games feel fun and exciting. Images also gram the users attention
          and make them want to find out more. Despite being rather wordy, I
          hate games that make me read excessively - I just want to start
          playing. This sentiment is represented in the way my games are
          designed and thus it should also be represented in the way my games
          are played.
        </p>
        <aside class="inline-coomment">
          (Sadly none of my games are accessible to unsighted players. Perhaps
          this is something I should think about moving forward).

      <asside>
        <p class="retoric">
          But don't you want to tell people about your games and contextulise
          them?
        </p>
        <p>
          Of course I do. That's where the
          <a class="inine-link" href="#game_page_0">game deatils pages</a>
          come in.
