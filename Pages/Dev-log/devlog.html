                broken down into two themes:

                      me. The sky presents the notion of endless posibilites and

                I wanted to used pictures of that I had taken myself (of which
                there are many). However these pictures are super pixalated. I
                then decided to draw pictures of the sky - which resulted in
                more than a few rabitholes of faffing. This was combined with my

                </span>
                ideat to turn my wesite into an interactive landscape that could
                be randomly generated with JavaScript. Hey, I'm sure it would've
                impressed the select few visitors willing to sit through the
                obligatory

              <p>
                By the end of it all the whole sky/world thing felt bloated and
                wasn't looking 'great;. Little useful progress had been made and
                I was concerened that the sky was irrelevant.

              It's not easy to pinpoint what UX is becuase it is so broad. The
              general concept of good UX is about making an

              What thoughs and emotions does it invoke in them? What does it

            <h2>What do i have so far...</h2>
            Not much if I'm honest. Up until now I have had a grand vision for
            my website: Each scene would be an interactive landscape with conten
            placed on the backdrop of a beuitiful sky. This would give visitors
            the experance of exploring a virtual world and a maze them with
            sutnning imegry. The sky has connotations of freadom and expenasion.
            I wanted the home page to be a sunrise to invoke the idea of new
            begginings.
          </section>
          <section>
            <h2>This sounds great! What's the porblem?</h2>
            This was one of the first ideas I had. It wasn't unthoughtful;
            however it was hardly the result of maticlous consideration. I love
            the sky - it looks great. But does it really speak to what I am
            trying to do? Anyne can go crazy with stock photos of sunrises, but
            few do. I'm not a photogroper. I'm not a travel agencey. Using the
            sky as a motif for this website is like using sports cars to
            advertise fast food. There is some sort of connection, but honestly
            it's a strach. Interactive landscapes my be fun at first, but they
            are not the content of my sight. This feature would hurt the
            perfomace of the website and offer more destraction than excitment.

          <section>
            <h2>I see. Coudn't you just dail things down. Why restart?</h2>
          </section>
          I could. But restarting will allow be to build a better site. When I
          began working on the site, I new nothing about web-dev, html, css or
          javascript. (I still no very little now - but I'm getting there). Th
          first attempt got messy and didn't really work out how I had planned.
          I can use that experance to be better this time. This is a learning
          experance and the best way to learn is to notice mistakes and imporve.

                  I was very focused on making my last website intresting for

                  have but planed to get). There will be a time to add some
                  flare. But for now it;s about baby steps. A slick and
                  porfessional website will probabay make better first
                  impression than an over-complicated and cumbersome one.

                  used mark-up for the sake of it, rather than to describe my

                  I need a clear vision for what my site is. Then I can desingn

                  I was not consistent when working on my site. I would often do
                  a single weekly binge session and then get disharented that
                  things were not coming together as I had invisiaged. This is
                  bad bad and bad practicing. The best way to learn and get good
                  at something is short but consitent engangment rather than
                  long sporadic sections. Doing a bit of dev work each day won't
                  nly be good for me to practive, it'll also ensure that the
                  site keeps growing. Furthermore, daily engament will leead to
                  more engaged and throughful desing beacuse of more frequent
                  engamnet. Putting of dev-work just means more time and stress
                  later down the line.

                  One of the reasons I haven't been devloping daily is becuase I
                  find my site ugly and baording. I want to make the finished
                  prodcut. I wan to do cool and inreting things for it. I want
                  to try out so many ideas, but I'm not there yet. I am ecited
                  to bring my website to life with JavaScript, but some of my
                  pages don't even have proper html. I've been trying to install
                  a home enterainment system in a house that doesn't exist. I
                  need to have the dicepline to focus on the task at hand. I
                  must build the scafold and the foundation first, then strat
                  paining and move in. This takes planing and self dicepline -
                  both of which have been lacking.
