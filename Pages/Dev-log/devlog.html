                    Up until quite recently most of the dev-log has been
                    scattered across disparate document. Some of it was
                    interesting. Some of it was hot garbage. Most of it will be
                    lost to time.

                    I'm currently in the process of adding the relevant entries

                  <p>
                    This website was originally going to be styled to look like
                    a sunrise… with each page based on the sky.
                  </p>
                  <img
                    class="log-img"
                    id="re_re_reboot_0_sunimg_0"
                    src="/Pages/Dev-log/Re-re-reboot_0-images/sky-concept.png"
                    alt="Conept art for blue-print themed dev-log"
                  /><br />
                  <label for="#re_re_reboot_0_sunimg_0" class="log-label">
                    Concept art for the homepage sunrise.
                  </label>
                  <p>
                    When visitors first landed on my homepage, they would be
                    greeted by a night sky. As they scrolled down, a glowing sun
                    would rise and illuminate the page. A beautiful first
                    impression! After that each page would have a sunrise
                    background to continue the motif.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This is the first website I've ever made - sunrises speak to
                    the idea of new beginnings. An open sky invokes the idea of
                    freedom and limitless possibilities. I also love watching
                    the sunrise, I find it calming and relaxing.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Furthermore, the sunrise let me use an awesome orange and
                    blue colour scheme. The vibrant and energetic orange
                    symbolised energy and enthusiasm while blue tempered this
                    with a calm and trustworthy tones. Orange and blue are also
                    contrasting colours so suing they could really make
                    each-other pop (or clash horribly if done wrong).
                  </p>
                  <img
                    class="log-img"
                    id="re_re_reboot_0_skyimg_1"
                    src="/Pages/Dev-log/Re-re-reboot_0-images/sky-screenshot.png"
                    alt="Screen shot of hompage with badly centered an pixeleated image of the sky"

                  <label for="#re_re_reboot_0_skyimg_1" class="log-label">
                    An early image of the formatted hompage.

                  <p>
                    It was convoluted and the code I was using was a mess. It
                    was becoming a pain to implement. It wasn't looking that
                    great either. I was new to html and the site was crippled by
                    a misshapn skeleton. It dawned on me that while the sunrise
                    spoke to my experience of making the website it was
                    completely unrelated to my skills as an engineer and game
                    designer. I felt that visitors to the site would have not
                    idea what it meant, what I did or what was going on.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In hindsight this was not a bad idea. (I was even tempted to
                    revert to it. The git branch for this reboot is even called
                    'back-to-sky'). It had the potential to be very
                    aesthetically pleasing and was filled with a lot of good
                    ideas.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The 'hello' world into screen and final colour scheme were
                    both cannibalised form this iteration. As was my choice to
                    use simple and readable body text.

                  <p>
                    This was a haphazard branch of the sunrise theme, originally
                    intended to be the design form my dev-log. I had the idea of
                    arranging elements on my website in constellations. I wanted
                    exploring the site to feel like looking though the night sky
                    invoking awe and wonder.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Setting something like this up is hard and I was trying to
                    show off with skills I didn't have. (Funny enough I think I
                    could pull it off now, but I know I shouldn't). This
                    iteration had all the bad parts of the sky one. The design
                    rationale was essentially: “it looks cool, and I like space”
                    The consultations were messy and hard to code. I stopped
                    working on the site and lost motivation.

                  <p>
                    An ironic theme for a failed plan. This time round the idea
                    had reason and logic to it. Blueprints speak to creativity
                    and design. They reflect technical capability and look
                    awful.
                  </p>
                  <img

                  <p>
                    To be fair they could've looked good, but I didn't have a
                    defined style guid, just a vague idea. As a result, I potted
                    around with 'blue-print-like' styling. I wanted the site to
                    look cutting edge but instead it looked like it came from
                    the 90's.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Again, not a bad idea, but horrid execution. Even now I am
                    shuddering. My mind is scarred with 'error screen blue'.

                    The wireframes for this iteration however where great and I
                    recycled some of their concepts for the final build. You may
                    recognise the dev-log timeline.

                    This was the next notable idea I had, and it formed the
                    framework for the site you are on right now. I'd begun to
                    realize a pattern with my failed sites. The ideas were
                    great, the rational was decent and the implementation was
                    hideous. Maybe my ideas were too big. Maybe I was giving up
                    to early. Maybe I wasn't focused. Most likely it was all the
                    above.

                    been implemented here, so you'll see plenty abridged
                    versions of my rambling in this log. Rainbows was less about
                    styling and more about a philosophy.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This time round I was focused on what the site said and how
                    it felt, rather than how it looked. I tried to be minimal in
                    my approach to avoid technical pit falls and I planned less
                    and did more.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    All my previous work had been subject to meticulous planning
                    and over-design. I spent hours saying what I was going to do
                    and then doing nothing. Rainbows meant to be more hands on.
                    I defined a core theme and style and then I was to set about
                    building a page that would fit it. Little by little, line by
                    line.

                  <p>
                    Importunely I'm still prone to massive deliberation. CSS is
                    a deep rabbit-hole and sematic markup is a bottomless pit. I
                    stubbled down both on my occasion along with an inability to
                    make simple design choices without 5000 revisions.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I still need to learn how to move on and say good enough is
                    good enough. But I am leaning, and I will get there.

                    The only major feature I dropped from rainbows was the
                    colour-scheme. I used all colours of the rainbow to make the
                    site look vibrant and colourful. This destroyed all
                    legibility and compositional unity. All the colours were
                    just a bit too much.

                  The back button was never well placed on my wireframes and has

                  The back button allows the user to go back to where they game
                  from. I'm renaming it the return button because the fits the
                  “programming” theme better. (Return is the command given to
                  leave a function).

                <section>
                  <h3 class="dev-h">What's the issue with it?</h3>
                  <p>
                    The back buttons on the blog and dev-log pages are a bit of
                    a mess. They float around haphazardly feeling like clutter
                    wherever they go.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I've moved most navigation and index features to the right,
                    which is great, but it means that there is even less space
                    for the button to naturally rest.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I was considering putting it on the nav bar - but I want the
                    nave bar to have the same fields throughout the site to give
                    a sense of consistency. The nav-bar is also quite cluttered
                    as it is.
                  </p>
                  <p class="retoric" aria-roledescription="retoric">
                    Can't the user just navigate with the nav bar? Why is return
                    so important?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Currently it's not doing that much. But once I start adding
                    some JS the return button will send the user back to their
                    previous page, wherever that was. This makes navigating the
                    site easier (which is never a bad thing). So, no. No, I do
                    not want to do away with the return button.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    To be honest I'm not sure where it should go. I could throw
                    it onto the right-hand side, but it would look weird and
                    lonely there. Besides, the website is in English which sets
                    a natural left-to right convention. Returning or going back
                    can be seen as leftwards movement, so putting a return
                    button on the right may seem unintuitive.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I'm going to be reformatting it to look like a piece of code
                    and throw it under the title. I'll pop it again at the
                    bottom of the article. Logically these are the two points
                    where a reader is most likely to decide they want to go
                    back. Either they haven't started and decide they'd rather
                    look at something else, or they finished reading and want to
                    go back.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    With this in mind I'll probably be floating a return button
                    above the index section and again at the bottom of the
                    article. Being above the index will put the button in the
                    comfortable top left corner - where one expects a back
                    button to be. The one at the bottom of the page let's users
                    return when they are finished reading. Is this overkill?
                    Perhaps a back at the end is goo enough. Is there a point in
                    asking someone to leave when they just arrived?
                  </p>
                </section>

                <p>
                  Possibly. I'll have to wait and see. I think I'll throw it in
                  at below the index (at least for now). This groups it with
                  naiation which seems logical. I can always re-move it
                  later&hellip;

                    So? Why not are semi colons, ampersands, or OTHER BRACKETS -
                    these are used in code too!
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Well, yes. But square ones are the best! (In my case
                    anyway).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Firstly, square brackets are often used for indexing in
                    programming languages. And this is how I am using brackets
                    on my site. They indicate tilts and section: items that
                    would appear in and index. If my site were some sort of
                    dictionary class, this is exactly how a under might expect
                    to retrieve the section associated with a title. Tying a
                    functional meaning to the elements is important because it
                    reinforces the connection to programming (and shows that I
                    know what I'm doing).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Other coding syntax elements lack his meaning. Semi-colons
                    are just line endings and curly brackets often just contain
                    sections of code. (As for good old round brackets, their
                    meaning is already well defined as an element of English
                    punctuation. Not not just meaningless, they're but confusing
                    too!)
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I also like square brackets because they appear strong and
                    confident. Most containers on this site have crisp, sharp
                    boarders with unrounded edges - square braces fit
                    comfortably into this astatic. (Although I must confess
                    square braces may have also informed this athletic)

                    I made used of the ::before and ::after CSS pseudo elements.
                    These elements render (you'll never guess this) before and
                    after their parent element. Think of them like the bullet
                    points on a list. They are pretty neat and simple to use.
                  </p>
                  <p>Just look at the code for the lower div:</p>
                  <pre>
                    <code class="code-sinp">
  &ltstyle&gt
   .square-bracket-good {
      font-weight: normal;
      color: black;
    }
    .square-bracket-good::before {
      content: "[";
      font-weight: bold;
      color: rgb(47, 177, 203);
      margin-right: 10px;
    }
    .square-bracket-good::after {
     content: "]";
     font-weight: bold;
     color: rgb(47, 177, 203);
     margin-left: 10px;
  }
  &lt/style&gt

  &ltdiv class="square-bracket-good"&gtSomething in brackets&lt/div&gt
                    </code>
                  </pre>

                    Did you notice the lack of braces? Well screen reader users
                    noticed that too! So did web crawlers and anything else that
                    is interfacing directly with the code on my site. Removing
                    square brackets and other decretive clutter makes the code
                    more sematic and machine readable.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Pseudo elements aren't real. They can't hurt you. (Pseudo
                    literally means fake!) These elements are defined entirely
                    with scc styling which means that, like all good children in
                    the Middle Ages, they can be seen but not heard.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Another great thing about the pseudo element approach is the
                    flexibility it gives me. Let's say I get hooked on C++ and
                    decide that titles aren't really indexes _ there're
                    pointers. So, I want to change all of the []'s into *'s. If
                    I need to change the characters next to every single
                    heading, I'd probably give up or pass out from boredom.
                    Fortunately, with pseudo elements this is as simple as
                    changing two lines of CSS . If the style s applied to a
                    class, this can allow innumerable html elements to be
                    reformatted.

                    Done! Now I must go get rid of all those legacy brackets on
                    my site. (Or write a program to do it for me). Wish me luck!
