                  The back button was never well placed on my wireframes and has

                  The back button allows the user to go back to where they game
                  from. I'm renaming it the return button because the fits the
                  “programming” theme better. (Return is the command given to
                  leave a function).

                  <h3 class="dev-h">What's the issue with it?</h3>
                  <p>
                    The back buttons on the blog and dev-log pages are a bit of
                    a mess. They float around haphazardly feeling like clutter
                    wherever they go.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I've moved most navigation and index features to the right,
                    which is great, but it means that there is even less space
                    for the button to naturally rest.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I was considering putting it on the nav bar - but I want the
                    nave bar to have the same fields throughout the site to give
                    a sense of consistency. The nav-bar is also quite cluttered
                    as it is.
                  </p>
                  <p class="retoric" aria-roledescription="retoric">
                    Can't the user just navigate with the nav bar? Why is return
                    so important?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Currently it's not doing that much. But once I start adding
                    some JS the return button will send the user back to their
                    previous page, wherever that was. This makes navigating the
                    site easier (which is never a bad thing). So, no. No, I do
                    not want to do away with the return button.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    To be honest I'm not sure where it should go. I could throw
                    it onto the right-hand side, but it would look weird and
                    lonely there. Besides, the website is in English which sets
                    a natural left-to right convention. Returning or going back
                    can be seen as leftwards movement, so putting a return
                    button on the right may seem unintuitive.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I'm going to be reformatting it to look like a piece of code
                    and throw it under the title. I'll pop it again at the
                    bottom of the article. Logically these are the two points
                    where a reader is most likely to decide they want to go
                    back. Either they haven't started and decide they'd rather
                    look at something else, or they finished reading and want to
                    go back.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    With this in mind I'll probably be floating a return button
                    above the index section and again at the bottom of the
                    article. Being above the index will put the button in the
                    comfortable top left corner - where one expects a back
                    button to be. The one at the bottom of the page let's users
                    return when they are finished reading. Is this overkill?
                    Perhaps a back at the end is goo enough. Is there a point in
                    asking someone to leave when they just arrived?
                  </p>
                </section>

                <p>
                  Possibly. I'll have to wait and see. I think I'll throw it in
                  at below the index (at least for now). This groups it with
                  naiation which seems logical. I can always re-move it
                  later&hellip;

                    So? Why not are semi colons, ampersands, or OTHER BRACKETS -
                    these are used in code too!
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Well, yes. But square ones are the best! (In my case
                    anyway).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Firstly, square brackets are often used for indexing in
                    programming languages. And this is how I am using brackets
                    on my site. They indicate tilts and section: items that
                    would appear in and index. If my site were some sort of
                    dictionary class, this is exactly how a under might expect
                    to retrieve the section associated with a title. Tying a
                    functional meaning to the elements is important because it
                    reinforces the connection to programming (and shows that I
                    know what I'm doing).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Other coding syntax elements lack his meaning. Semi-colons
                    are just line endings and curly brackets often just contain
                    sections of code. (As for good old round brackets, their
                    meaning is already well defined as an element of English
                    punctuation. Not not just meaningless, they're but confusing
                    too!)
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I also like square brackets because they appear strong and
                    confident. Most containers on this site have crisp, sharp
                    boarders with unrounded edges - square braces fit
                    comfortably into this astatic. (Although I must confess
                    square braces may have also informed this athletic)

                  Look at these two random containers:

                    I can't even understand what you are saying.

                    Exactly! That's what happens if <em>decorative</em> square
                    brackets are added as inline characters. Like I did with the
                    first div (and most of the early headers on this site).

                  <p>
                    Take a look at the code for the first one to see what I
                    mean:
                  </p>
                  <pre>
                    <code class="code-sinp">
  &ltstyle&gt
    .square-bracket-bad {
      font-weight: bold;
      color: rgb(47, 177, 203);
    }
    .square-bracket-bad .inner {
      font-weight: normal;
      color: black;
      margin: 0 10px;
    }
  &lt/style&gt

  &ltdiv class="square-bracket-bad"&gt
    [&ltspan class="inner"&gtSomething in brackets&lt/span&gt]
  &lt/div&gt
                    </code>
                  </pre>

                  <p class="retoric" aria-roledescription="retoric">
                    Oh dear. That's a bummer... I'm guessing the second div is
                    different...

                </section>
                <section>
                  <h3 class="sub-h">How do you fix this></h3>
                  <p>
                    Magic.
                    <span class="inline-comment"
                      >(Actually CSS, which is basically the same thing.)</span
                    >
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I made used of the ::before and ::after CSS pseudo elements.
                    These elements render (you'll never guess this) before and
                    after their parent element. Think of them like the bullet
                    points on a list. They are pretty neat and simple to use.
                  </p>
                  <p>Just look at the code for the lower div:</p>
                  <pre>
                    <code class="code-sinp">
  &ltstyle&gt
   .square-bracket-good {
      font-weight: normal;
      color: black;
    }
    .square-bracket-good::before {
      content: "[";
      font-weight: bold;
      color: rgb(47, 177, 203);
      margin-right: 10px;
    }
    .square-bracket-good::after {
     content: "]";
     font-weight: bold;
     color: rgb(47, 177, 203);
     margin-left: 10px;
  }
  &lt/style&gt

  &ltdiv class="square-bracket-good"&gtSomething in brackets&lt/div&gt
                    </code>
                  </pre>

                    Did you notice the lack of braces? Well screen reader users
                    noticed that too! So did web crawlers and anything else that
                    is interfacing directly with the code on my site. Removing
                    square brackets and other decretive clutter makes the code
                    more sematic and machine readable.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Pseudo elements aren't real. They can't hurt you. (Pseudo
                    literally means fake!) These elements are defined entirely
                    with scc styling which means that, like all good children in
                    the Middle Ages, they can be seen but not heard.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Another great thing about the pseudo element approach is the
                    flexibility it gives me. Let's say I get hooked on C++ and
                    decide that titles aren't really indexes _ there're
                    pointers. So, I want to change all of the []'s into '’s. If
                    I need to change the characters next to every single
                    heading, I'd probably give up or pass out from boredom.
                    Fortunately, with pseudo elements this is as simple as
                    changing two lines of CSS . If the style s applied to a
                    class, this can allow innumerable html elements to be
                    reformatted.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Done! Now I must go get rid of all those legacy brackets on
                    my site. (Or write a program to do it for me). Wish me luck!
