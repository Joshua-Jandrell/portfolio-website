                  . But using inline text elements to represent them is tedious
                  and creates clutter for screen reader users: there must be a

                    So? Why not are semi colons, ampersands, or OTHER BRACKETS -
                    these are used in code too!
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Well, yes. But square ones are the best! (In my case
                    anyway).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Firstly, square brackets are often used for indexing in
                    programming languages. And this is how I am using brackets
                    on my site. They indicate tilts and section: items that
                    would appear in and index. If my site were some sort of
                    dictionary class, this is exactly how a under might expect
                    to retrieve the section associated with a title. Tying a
                    functional meaning to the elements is important because it
                    reinforces the connection to programming (and shows that I
                    know what I'm doing).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Other coding syntax elements lack his meaning. Semi-colons
                    are just line endings and curly brackets often just contain
                    sections of code. (As for good old round brackets, their
                    meaning is already well defined as an element of English
                    punctuation. Not not just meaningless, they're but confusing
                    too!)
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I also like square brackets because they appear strong and
                    confident. Most containers on this site have crisp, sharp
                    boarders with unrounded edges - square braces fit
                    comfortably into this astatic. (Although I must confess
                    square braces may have also informed this athletic)

                  Look at these two random containers:
                  <article class="demo-square-bracket-divs">
                    <div class="square-bracket-bad">

                    </div>
                    <div class="square-bracket-good">Something in brackets</div>

                    If you are viewing this site on a monitor, they probably
                    look the same. But if you view them with a screen reader one
                    is haven then the other is hell. (And not becuase of that
                    top and bottom thing.)
                  </p>
                  <p class="retoric" aria-roledescription="retoric">

                    Open square bracket imagine close square bracket if I spoke

                    Exactly! That's what happens if <em>decorative</em> square
                    brackets are added as inline characters. Like I did with the
                    first div (and most of the early headers on this site).

                  <p>
                    Take a look at the code for the first one to see what I
                    mean:

      font-weight: bold;

    }
    .square-bracket-bad .inner {
      font-weight: normal;
      color: black;
      margin: 0 10px;
    }
  &lt/style&gt

  &ltdiv class="square-bracket-bad"&gt

                    Oh dear. That's a bummer... I'm guessing the second div is

                    Magic.
                    <span class="inline-comment"
                      >(Actually CSS, which is basically the same thing.)</span

                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I made used of the ::before and ::after CSS pseudo elements.
                    These elements render (you'll never guess this) before and
                    after their parent element. Think of them like the bullet
                    points on a list. They are pretty neat and simple to use.
                  </p>
                  <p>Just look at the code for the lower div:</p>
                  <pre>
                    <code class="code-sinp">
  &ltstyle&gt
   .square-bracket-good {
      font-weight: normal;
      color: black;
    }
    .square-bracket-good::before {
      content: "[";
      font-weight: bold;
      color: rgb(47, 177, 203);
      margin-right: 10px;
    }
    .square-bracket-good::after {
     content: "]";
     font-weight: bold;
     color: rgb(47, 177, 203);
     margin-left: 10px;
  }
  &lt/style&gt

  &ltdiv class="square-bracket-good"&gtSomething in brackets&lt/div&gt
