                    Up until quite recently most of the dev-log has been
                    scattered across disparate document. Some of it was
                    interesting. Some of it was hot garbage. Most of it will be
                    lost to time.

                    I'm currently in the process of adding the relevant entries

                    previous iterations of the site. (I really do faff a lot).

                  <p>
                    This website was originally going to be styled to look like
                    a sunrise… with each page based on the sky.
                  </p>
                  <img
                    class="log-img"
                    id="re_re_reboot_0_sunimg_0"
                    src="/Pages/Dev-log/Re-re-reboot_0-images/sky-concept.png"
                    alt="Conept art for blue-print themed dev-log"
                  /><br />
                  <label for="#re_re_reboot_0_sunimg_0" class="log-label">
                    Concept art for the homepage sunrise.
                  </label>
                  <p>
                    When visitors first landed on my homepage, they would be
                    greeted by a night sky. As they scrolled down, a glowing sun
                    would rise and illuminate the page. A beautiful first
                    impression! After that each page would have a sunrise
                    background to continue the motif.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This is the first website I've ever made - sunrises speak to
                    the idea of new beginnings. An open sky invokes the idea of
                    freedom and limitless possibilities. I also love watching
                    the sunrise, I find it calming and relaxing.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Furthermore, the sunrise let me use an awesome orange and
                    blue colour scheme. The vibrant and energetic orange
                    symbolised energy and enthusiasm while blue tempered this
                    with a calm and trustworthy tones. Orange and blue are also
                    contrasting colours so suing they could really make
                    each-other pop (or clash horribly if done wrong).
                  </p>

                    It was convoluted and the code I was using was a mess. It
                    was becoming a pain to implement. It wasn't looking that
                    great either. I was new to html and the site was crippled by
                    a misshapn skeleton. It dawned on me that while the sunrise
                    spoke to my experience of making the website it was
                    completely unrelated to my skills as an engineer and game
                    designer. I felt that visitors to the site would have not
                    idea what it meant, what I did or what was going on.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In hindsight this was not a bad idea. (I was even tempted to
                    revert to it. The git branch for this reboot is even called
                    'back-to-sky'). It had the potential to be very
                    aesthetically pleasing and was filled with a lot of good
                    ideas.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The 'hello' world into screen and final colour scheme were
                    both cannibalised form this iteration. As was my choice to
                    use simple and readable body text.

                  <p>
                    This was a haphazard branch of the sunrise theme, originally
                    intended to be the design form my dev-log. I had the idea of
                    arranging elements on my website in constellations. I wanted
                    exploring the site to feel like looking though the night sky
                    invoking awe and wonder.

                    Setting something like this up is hard and I was trying to
                    show off with skills I didn't have. (Funny enough I think I
                    could pull it off now, but I know I shouldn't). This
                    iteration had all the bad parts of the sky one. The design
                    rationale was essentially: “it looks cool, and I like space”
                    The consultations were messy and hard to code. I stopped
                    working on the site and lost motivation.

                  <p>
                    An ironic theme for a failed plan. This time round the idea
                    had reason and logic to it. Blueprints speak to creativity
                    and design. They reflect technical capability and look
                    awful.

                    To be fair they could've looked good, but I didn't have a
                    defined style guid, just a vague idea. As a result, I potted
                    around with 'blue-print-like' styling. I wanted the site to
                    look cutting edge but instead it looked like it came from
                    the 90's.

                    Again, not a bad idea, but horrid execution. Even now I am

                    The wireframes for this iteration however where great and I
                    recycled some of their concepts for the final build. You may

                    This was the next notable idea I had, and it formed the
                    framework for the site you are on right now. I'd begun to
                    realize a pattern with my failed sites. The ideas were
                    great, the rational was decent and the implementation was
                    hideous. Maybe my ideas were too big. Maybe I was giving up
                    to early. Maybe I wasn't focused. Most likely it was all the
                    above.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A lot of the style and structure details for rainbows have
                    been implemented here, so you'll see plenty abridged
                    versions of my rambling in this log. Rainbows was less about
                    styling and more about a philosophy.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This time round I was focused on what the site said and how
                    it felt, rather than how it looked. I tried to be minimal in
                    my approach to avoid technical pit falls and I planned less
                    and did more.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    All my previous work had been subject to meticulous planning
                    and over-design. I spent hours saying what I was going to do
                    and then doing nothing. Rainbows meant to be more hands on.
                    I defined a core theme and style and then I was to set about
                    building a page that would fit it. Little by little, line by
                    line.

                  <p>
                    Importunely I'm still prone to massive deliberation. CSS is
                    a deep rabbit-hole and sematic markup is a bottomless pit. I
                    stubbled down both on my occasion along with an inability to
                    make simple design choices without 5000 revisions.

                  <p>
                    I still need to learn how to move on and say good enough is
                    good enough. But I am leaning, and I will get there.

                    The only major feature I dropped from rainbows was the
                    colour-scheme. I used all colours of the rainbow to make the
                    site look vibrant and colourful. This destroyed all
                    legibility and compositional unity. All the colours were
                    just a bit too much.

                  The back button allows the user to go back to where they game
                  from. I'm renaming it the return button because the fits the
                  “programming” theme better. (Return is the command given to
                  leave a function).

                  <h3 class="dev-h">What's the issue with it?</h3>
                  <p>
                    The back buttons on the blog and dev-log pages are a bit of
                    a mess. They float around haphazardly feeling like clutter
                    wherever they go.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I've moved most navigation and index features to the right,
                    which is great, but it means that there is even less space
                    for the button to naturally rest.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I was considering putting it on the nav bar - but I want the
                    nave bar to have the same fields throughout the site to give
                    a sense of consistency. The nav-bar is also quite cluttered
                    as it is.
                  </p>
                  <p class="retoric" aria-roledescription="retoric">
                    Can't the user just navigate with the nav bar? Why is return
                    so important?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Currently it's not doing that much. But once I start adding
                    some JS the return button will send the user back to their
                    previous page, wherever that was. This makes navigating the
                    site easier (which is never a bad thing). So, no. No, I do
                    not want to do away with the return button.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    To be honest I'm not sure where it should go. I could throw
                    it onto the right-hand side, but it would look weird and
                    lonely there. Besides, the website is in English which sets
                    a natural left-to right convention. Returning or going back
                    can be seen as leftwards movement, so putting a return
                    button on the right may seem unintuitive.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I'm going to be reformatting it to look like a piece of code
                    and throw it under the title. I'll pop it again at the
                    bottom of the article. Logically these are the two points
                    where a reader is most likely to decide they want to go
                    back. Either they haven't started and decide they'd rather
                    look at something else, or they finished reading and want to
                    go back.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    With this in mind I'll probably be floating a return button
                    above the index section and again at the bottom of the
                    article. Being above the index will put the button in the
                    comfortable top left corner - where one expects a back
                    button to be. The one at the bottom of the page let's users
                    return when they are finished reading. Is this overkill?
                    Perhaps a back at the end is goo enough. Is there a point in
                    asking someone to leave when they just arrived?
                  </p>
                </section>

                <p>
                  Possibly. I'll have to wait and see. I think I'll throw it in
                  at below the index (at least for now). This groups it with
                  naiation which seems logical. I can always re-move it
                  later&hellip;

                    So? Why not are semi colons, ampersands, or OTHER BRACKETS -
                    these are used in code too!
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Well, yes. But square ones are the best! (In my case
                    anyway).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Firstly, square brackets are often used for indexing in
                    programming languages. And this is how I am using brackets
                    on my site. They indicate tilts and section: items that
                    would appear in and index. If my site were some sort of
                    dictionary class, this is exactly how a under might expect
                    to retrieve the section associated with a title. Tying a
                    functional meaning to the elements is important because it
                    reinforces the connection to programming (and shows that I
                    know what I'm doing).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Other coding syntax elements lack his meaning. Semi-colons
                    are just line endings and curly brackets often just contain
                    sections of code. (As for good old round brackets, their
                    meaning is already well defined as an element of English
                    punctuation. Not not just meaningless, they're but confusing
                    too!)
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I also like square brackets because they appear strong and
                    confident. Most containers on this site have crisp, sharp
                    boarders with unrounded edges - square braces fit
                    comfortably into this astatic. (Although I must confess
                    square braces may have also informed this athletic)

                    first div (and most of the early headers on this site).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Take a look at the code for the first one to see what I
                    mean:
                  </p>
                  <pre>
                    <code class="code-sinp">
  &ltstyle&gt
    .square-bracket-bad {
      font-weight: bold;
      color: rgb(47, 177, 203);
    }
    .square-bracket-bad .inner {
      font-weight: normal;
      color: black;
      margin: 0 10px;
    }
  &lt/style&gt

  &ltdiv class="square-bracket-bad"&gt
    [&ltspan class="inner"&gtSomething in brackets&lt/span&gt]
  &lt/div&gt
                    </code>

                    Oh dear. That's a bummer... I'm guessing the second div is

                  <p>
                    Magic.
                    <span class="inline-comment"
                      >(Actually CSS, which is basically the same thing.)</span
                    >
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I made used of the ::before and ::after CSS pseudo elements.
                    These elements render (you'll never guess this) before and
                    after their parent element. Think of them like the bullet
                    points on a list. They are pretty neat and simple to use.
                  </p>
                  <p>Just look at the code for the lower div:</p>
                  <pre>
                    <code class="code-sinp">
  &ltstyle&gt
   .square-bracket-good {
      font-weight: normal;
      color: black;
    }
    .square-bracket-good::before {
      content: "[";
      font-weight: bold;
      color: rgb(47, 177, 203);
      margin-right: 10px;
    }
    .square-bracket-good::after {
     content: "]";
     font-weight: bold;
     color: rgb(47, 177, 203);
     margin-left: 10px;
  }
  &lt/style&gt

  &ltdiv class="square-bracket-good"&gtSomething in brackets&lt/div&gt
                    </code>
                  </pre>
                  <p>
                    Did you notice the lack of braces? Well screen reader users
                    noticed that too! So did web crawlers and anything else that
                    is interfacing directly with the code on my site. Removing
                    square brackets and other decretive clutter makes the code
                    more sematic and machine readable.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Pseudo elements aren't real. They can't hurt you. (Pseudo
                    literally means fake!) These elements are defined entirely
                    with scc styling which means that, like all good children in
                    the Middle Ages, they can be seen but not heard.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Another great thing about the pseudo element approach is the
                    flexibility it gives me. Let's say I get hooked on C++ and
                    decide that titles aren't really indexes _ there're
                    pointers. So, I want to change all of the []'s into *'s. If
                    I need to change the characters next to every single
                    heading, I'd probably give up or pass out from boredom.
                    Fortunately, with pseudo elements this is as simple as
                    changing two lines of CSS . If the style s applied to a
                    class, this can allow innumerable html elements to be
                    reformatted.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Done! Now I must go get rid of all those legacy brackets on
                    my site. (Or write a program to do it for me). Wish me luck!

                  <h3 class="dev-h">So how will this all work?</h3>
                  <p>
                    Naturally these will be a selection of articles which I
                    think are great and that I want the visitor to read. If the
                    visitor want's to look at my work this is a great think to
                    point them to my best work without putting it on a pedestal.
                    (I mean it kinda is on a pedestal - but it's a gentle nudge
                    rather than a violent push.)
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This isn't really about navigation: it's about showing the
                    visitor that I'm busy with a bunch of interesting projects.
                    This enforces the idea that they should continue exploring
                    the site because it has a lot to offer. It also makes me
                    look engaged and interesting as a designer.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    If a particular article catches the visitors attention, it
                    will open in a new tab. This encourages them to return to
                    the home page and keep exploring.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The caption 'explore' is a call to action which should
                    encourage victors to follow the links.

                  <p>
                    This will be a simple grid. A gird layout is less hierarchal
                    than a stacked list and gives the impression of variety and
                    organisation. Grid provide strcture and order which make the
                    site appeare well constructed and solidly put togerther.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The articles will be represented by large icons to make
                    clicking easy. Each article will have a short preview to
                    create intrigue. The layout is simple and minimal so that
                    the visitor can take the site in without feeling
                    overwhelmed.

                  <p>
                    The homepage has to make a good impression. It is likely the
                    first (and possibly only) thing with visitors to my site

                  <p>
                    It needs to amaze them, interest them and make them want to
                    see more! I may not have long to get a visitators attention.
                    Visors must be enthralled but they should be able to
                    immediately know what I do when they glace at my webpage.

                  That will be the first message visitors see when they land on
                  my site. I know it's quite cliched, however it says a lot.
                  When learning to program in a new language, printing 'hello
                  world' is one of the first programs one writes. Opening with
                  'hello world' immediately tells the visitor - 'Hey I'm a
                  programmer. I made this.
                </p>
                <p>
                  "Hellow World" is also a greeting to the world. I'm
                  acknowledging that I have just gone live on the internet for
                  the first time. And that's pretty cool! This grounds also
                  grounds me: it acknowledges that I have just begun my journey
                  as a developer and still need to lean and grow while alos
                  commemerating that fact that I am live on the wrold wide web.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The visitor is just greeted by a back screen with 'Hello
                  world' on it. It should feel like the command consol. Empty
                  and blank. A monospace font is used to enhance this effect.

                  They then scroll down and the site is revealed. The emergence

                  As the visitor scrolls they unveil the site. In due course
                  JavaScript will help me make this experience feel exciting and
                  polished. This will transform the mundane act of scrolling
                  down a webpage into an adventure. As the viewer scrolls down
                  the site they become curios to see how things will change and
                  what will come next. While scrolling, I introduce myself and I
                  invite the visitor to look around the site. I don't
                  necessarily expect them to follow my prompts. I just want them
                  to keep scrolling.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Once hey have started so they'll probably continue. I don't
                  expect victors to explore my whole site (even if I would like
                  them to) they'll probably just look at the homepage. Following
                  hyperlinks implies distance and travel. The visitor has so
                  many option to chose from an chose nothing as a result.
                </p>
                <p>
                  But what is the whole site is a homepage? If the about, blogs,
                  game and so on are all on my home page already then the
                  visitor will feel there is more to explore. They won't have
                  got to the bottom and this incompleteness if powerful. When I
                  add JS to the site I will turn the top navigation bar into a
                  progress bar to sell the effect even more.
                </p>
                <p>
                  By the time a visitor scrolls to the bottom they will have
                  seen the overview I wanted to give them.

                  What impression do I want to make and what message should the

                  <h3 class="dev-h">Oh gosh - I hate self promotion</h3>
                  <p>
                    A quick note before we begin. I am a firm believer of the
                    age old writing rule: “show don't tell” (Kinda ironic that
                    I'm telling you this).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I find that claiming to be good at something is about as
                    meaningful as measuring the weigh of a box by looking at it.
                    Terms like 'good'; 'great'; 'excellent' and 'horrible' are
                    all relative. Everyone has their own personal standard and
                    then we get the Dunning-Kruger effect. Sure you can have
                    something measurable like experience of qualification - but
                    that alone doesn't necessarily imply meticulous craft,
                    personal growth and artistic flare.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The best way to convince someone I have the skills they want
                    is to show them what I can do. Fortunately a portfolio is
                    designed to do just that - yay!
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Unfortunate, when designing the portfolio I have to try and
                    emphasise what I am good at and trick people into thinking
                    it. In some cases I might need to claim that I am 'good' at
                    things - without proving anything. I know it can be cringy
                    worthy and I'll be cringing with you. But self-promotion is
                    the aim of this game (actually it's a website) and I'd show
                    myself to be a pretty poor designer if my system didn't do
                    that.

                <section id="what_is_this_2">
                  <h3 class="dev-h">What am I doing with this website?</h3>
                  <p>
                    It is a portfolio website. So its primary purpose is to sell
                    a product and that product is me.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This website will hold my portfolio as a game designer - but
                    also as a critical and systems thinker. As a designer I tend
                    to focus more on technical implementation and system design
                    than art and animation. The website needs to highlight these
                    strengths and convince the visitor that they need my
                    services.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I am fortunate because the skills I wish to convey are
                    deeply linked to web-development. If this website delivers a
                    smooth system and a good user experience, then the site
                    itself becomes the portfolio.

                  <h3 class="dev-h">Who is me and why do you want him?</h3>
                  <p>
                    Anyone visiting a portfolio website is aware that the
                    purpose of the site is to impress them. The expect to see me
                    standing in a suit and tie to show them my best-polished
                    brass.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Trying to impress people is not very impressive. I could be
                    a clean cut cooperate coder, but I might also come of as a
                    sleazy snake-oil salesman. One is dubious, and frankly the
                    other is quite boring.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I don't want my website to feel pretentiously professional,
                    nor do I want it to feel like a self-pitch. I want to give
                    it a casual vibe. I want visitors to see that I am
                    passionate about what I am doing and feel that I am sharing
                    that passion with them. I want them to think of this website
                    as a dialog rather than a business pitch, a sharing ideas
                    rather than an exhibition. Hopefully this will feel more
                    genuine and make me seem like a creative and interesting
                    human, rather than just another cut-out candidate.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As an engineer-to be (if all goes according to my current
                    plans) I have a creative edge over most technical graduates.
                    I would have competed several humanities focused courses and
                    engaged more deeply with the artistic and philosophical
                    aspects of technology. Making games provides great incites
                    into UX, UI and human centerer systems. These are useful and
                    transferable skills when it comes to systems design an
                    implantation.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As an artist and designer the convers is true. I would have
                    a professional technical degree.
                  </p>
                  <p class="imp">
                    Technical creatively is my unique selling point.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But what sets me apart form other people who have the same
                    qualification as me? My meness. I like to think that I am
                    driven and strive for excellence yet remain playful and love
                    my work. (I do tend to overthinking, I'm a victim to over
                    scoping, perfection paralysis, rambling and going off on
                    tangents from my tangents - but that's me too.) I want the
                    site to reflect that duality. Professional, yet playful.
                    Clear yet creative. (Prone to random tangents and probably
                    quite extra; yet well oiled and reliable when it matters).

                    So you've waffled about yourself but what about your site?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Simple. The site just needs to reflect everything I just
                    said. And now the question is how.
