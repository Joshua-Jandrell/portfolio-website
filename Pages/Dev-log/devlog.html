                    Clickable icons makes it quick and easy for visitors to
                    contact me. They can do it with a single mouse click rather
                    than having to open up their mail app and paste in an
                    address. The structure is simple and to the point -
                    contacting me should be easy and effortless so I'd like to
                    avoid clutter.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    WhatsApp and telegram icons will allow visitors to send me
                    messages. I will not display phone number because I want
                    people to email or message me, rather than calling.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I'll pop in a link to my git-hub (even though most of my
                    repos are private at this stage). This is where most of my
                    game code is kept so it makes sent to give curios visitors a
                    chance to take a look.

                  <p>
                    I'm planning to make an itch account some time soon, so I'll
                    set up a link from that in when its ready.

                  <p>
                    There are some linkes to prominent sigts missing. I have a
                    couple work-related YouTube videos but they aren't very
                    relevant and I don't upload often. I do not have linked in,
                    twitter or face book (yet) - so no point in linking there.
                    My Instagram and Pinterest accounts aren't applicable (and
                    aren't in use much anyway).

                  <p>
                    I think I will add a small contact section at the bottom of
                    blog pages too. Just to make it more conveneinet to give me
                    feedback.

                    Of course all of the logos I am using are official downloads
                    and I am following each companies logo guidelines.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I want to include the WhatsApp logo. But the official logos
                    are awful. They all float on a giant off-white back ground
                    so when they are next to the logos of respectable companies
                    they look tiny.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It's a pity: but it is what it is… (I've removed the
                    background from one and cropped it . I believe this does not
                    go against the logo use agreement because I haven't modified
                    the logo itself and I've left the required whitespace around
                    it.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It's not my business - but this stuff matters! Surly meta
                    want me to send traffic to their platform? Shouldn't they
                    make it easy to use their logo instead of a pain? (I used it
                    anyway so maybe not.)

                  <p class="retoric" aria-roledescription="retoric">WHY?</p>
                  <p>
                    Because this shows that development is a continuous process
                    and that or articles are related and follow chronologically.
                    In contrast each blog post convers a different topic.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The timeline motif will be in the main dev-log section to
                    show that it is a cautious process. This also indicates that
                    entireties build on what has already be done.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Sections in the dev-log will be collapsed using the
                    &lt;details&gt; and &lt;summary&gt; widget so that users can
                    scroll through the log more easily.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I am slightly concerned that with time a single continuous
                    document of this nature will become difficult to manage and
                    slow to load. I may need to add some sort of document
                    fetching system using JS.

                    How should the blog section and blog posts be structured?

                    Games will be followed by a blog section. Visitor's know
                    what I do but now they get to see who I am. The blogs should
                    feel conversational and I'll try to make them a bit
                    humorous.

                  <h3 class="dev-h">Why should the blogs be informal?</h3>
                  <p>
                    I want to give the impression that the blogs are not
                    censored or formalised. Using casual language like
                    contraction shows that that the blogs aren't meant to be
                    overly academic or formal. The deformalized context makes
                    them feel more genuine. This section gives visitors an idea
                    of who I am and how I think. I'm not going to give any false
                    pretences.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    That said, I'm also not going to be an idol. This is the
                    internet: putting too much of myself out there is dangerous
                    and might come to bite me. I need to set boundary. I won't
                    share everything or pour my heart out. I'll give my genuine
                    opinions, but not all my opinions. I'll avoid swearing
                    (event though everyone f@king does it) and try not to make
                    and radically contentious claims. I must bare in mind that I
                    am a brand and I can't bring my future employer's name into
                    disrepute.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I know this approach is a bit of a cop-out. Perhaps as I get
                    more confident about being online I'll get bolder. This is
                    still quite scary for me: I don't even use social media.

                    Recent blogs are most prominent, displayed in large blocks
                    to the left - a natural starting point for the
                    English-reader's eye. New work emphasised here because it is
                    likely better and more topical. A short blurb is porvided
                    for each post to get the visitor interested to read more.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    There is a list of all blogs is placed in a scroll space to
                    the right for easy reference. This shows viewer there is
                    more to read if they want. As the blog gets bigger I might
                    sort blog entries into lists based on category and have a
                    more comprehensive display of blogs on a seperate page. I
                    may also add a search feature in further. For now this
                    should be fine.

                  <p>
                    Splash text (will eventually be randomised) is placed below
                    the blog title. This sets a conversational tone and makes
                    things fun. Blog section should feel friendly and inviting.

                    This is particularly helpful for screen reader users.

                    Back button next to title, allows the user to return to main

                  <p>
                    The related blog sections are included to enrage the visitor
                    to keep reading. They are paced on the side and agian at the
                    bottom. The bottom ones will be in the same preview format
                    that is used on the homepage. when the reader reaches the
                    bottom of the page they are finished with the blog - sample
                    posts should help to get them interested in something else.

                    Share icons will allow the user to share the url over their

                    following site:

                <p>
                  A short description about the game is very important because
                  many of my games were made with limited time and I wasn't able
                  to do everything I wanted. I need to explain what I was trying
                  to do and what I was able to do. I will try keep this frank,
                  breif and to the point so that visitors can get on with
                  playing. This section is placed above the download section to
                  encourage the viewer to read about my game first and
                  understand the context before they play it.
                </p>
                <p>
                  However, the download section should be prominent and
                  distinctly formatted; making easy for one to download and play
                  the game. That's what they are here for after all.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This is followed by a credits section. Giving credits to
                  myself and acknowledging the contribution of others is simply
                  good practice - especially on a portfolio site. This may also
                  allow me to link to my colleagues' websites in the future
                  which is pretty cool!
                </p>
                <p>
                  Back button encourages the viewer to easily return to the
                  homepage and engage with more content.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Share and feedback buttons are to encourage further
                  engagement. I'd love my games to get exposure or learn how I
                  could improve If the viewer does either its very beneficial to
                  me. These are at the bottom because I assume most users would
                  like to experience the content before they wish to talk about
                  it.

                  Images of gameplay will be placed down the right-hand side to
                  give the visitor a preview of what's in the game without being
                  intrusive or distracting. I considered videos but I'd rather
                  people played my games to experience them for themselves.

                    work and more like and informal showcase things I want to
                    share.

                    One is trying to impress, the other is trying to enthuse.
                    One is formal and passive, the other is clear and confident.
                    I want to come across and enthusiastic and passionate
                    because that will reflect that I would make and diligent and
                    motivated employee.

                  <p>
                    This also means that 'games' is displayed on the nav-bar
                    allowing visitors to quicky surmise that I make games when
                    they land on the site - there is not question about what
                    work I do.

                  <p>
                    I'm not just a game designer, I do other things too.Perhaps
                    in time I'll add a portfolio of more technical work too. If
                    this is the case separate sections are logical because,
                    employers from different fields would be interested in
                    different things.

                    This is similar to the Home/'explore' section. The grid
                    makes the site feel well constructed. The grid is also
                    reminiscent of game applications on a desktop or smartphone
                    making the presentation familiar to users. They should
                    easily understand that clicking on the game will open it (or
                    open a page about it).

                  <p>
                    Games will predominantly be represented by pictures. Reading
                    is a laborious while pictures are fun and require less
                    effort. This makes the games feel fun and exciting. Images
                    also gram the users attention and make them want to find out
                    more. Despite being rather wordy, I hate games that make me
                    read excessively - I just want to start playing. This
                    sentiment is represented in the way my games are designed
                    and thus it should also be represented in the way my games
                    are played.

                  <p>
                    I don't know how long a visitor will scroll so it's
                    important I get to the point. Once have show them a bit of
                    what I do (in the home navigation section) I should tell
                    them who I am. The point of the site is to market myself so
                    I should get to the product (me) as soon as possible.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This part should be short an to the point so that the
                    visitor feels it will not take too long to read.

                  <p>
                    It will make extensive use of collapsible inline text so
                    that if the viewer wants to read more they can, without the
                    section feeling too long or wordy. This also allows vistor
                    to interact with the site, deliveing a more engaging and
                    intresting experance.

                    I don't want to come off as pretentiously formal so this
                    will be a bit tongue in cheek. As much as I want to seem
                    qualified, I also want to sound interesting.

                      heading. This will make the section layout appear more
                      interesting and less text-heavy. I assume that this will
                      lead the viewer eyes downwards diagonally. Their eyes will
                      then move from the title to the profile picture and then
                      to the text. They will then move back and read the contact

                      not feel like obnoxious clutter. These icons encourage the
                      visitor to reach out to me (which is exactly what I want

                    Gosh this is awful! Nothing behaves How I want it to. I used
                    the &lt;section&gt; and &lt;details&gt; widget to make the
                    popout more accessible- but they don't stay I one line. When
                    they are opened they fly to the bottom of the page for some
                    reason which looks awful.

                    Perhaps I can make these work better with JavaScript later

                  <p>
                    Naturally these will be a selection of articles which I
                    think are great and that I want the visitor to read. If the
                    visitor want's to look at my work this is a great think to
                    point them to my best work without putting it on a pedestal.
                    (I mean it kinda is on a pedestal - but it's a gentle nudge
                    rather than a violent push.)
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This isn't really about navigation: it's about showing the
                    visitor that I'm busy with a bunch of interesting projects.
                    This enforces the idea that they should continue exploring
                    the site because it has a lot to offer. It also makes me
                    look engaged and interesting as a designer.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    If a particular article catches the visitors attention, it
                    will open in a new tab. This encourages them to return to
                    the home page and keep exploring.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The caption 'explore' is a call to action which should
                    encourage victors to follow the links.

                    This will be a simple grid. A gird layout is less hierarchal
                    than a stacked list and gives the impression of variety and
                    organisation. Grid provide strcture and order which make the
                    site appeare well constructed and solidly put togerther.

                  <p>
                    The articles will be represented by large icons to make

                  <p>
                    The homepage has to make a good impression. It is likely the
                    first (and possibly only) thing with visitors to my site
                    will see.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It needs to amaze them, interest them and make them want to
                    see more! I may not have long to get a visitators attention.
                    Visors must be enthralled but they should be able to
                    immediately know what I do when they glace at my webpage.

                  That will be the first message visitors see when they land on
                  my site. I know it's quite cliched, however it says a lot.
                  When learning to program in a new language, printing 'hello
                  world' is one of the first programs one writes. Opening with
                  'hello world' immediately tells the visitor - 'Hey I'm a
                  programmer. I made this.
                </p>
                <p>
                  "Hellow World" is also a greeting to the world. I'm
                  acknowledging that I have just gone live on the internet for
                  the first time. And that's pretty cool! This grounds also
                  grounds me: it acknowledges that I have just begun my journey
                  as a developer and still need to lean and grow while alos
                  commemerating that fact that I am live on the wrold wide web.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The visitor is just greeted by a back screen with 'Hello
                  world' on it. It should feel like the command consol. Empty
                  and blank. A monospace font is used to enhance this effect.

                  They then scroll down and the site is revealed. The emergence
                  of a bright and polished sight should have a significant

                  As the visitor scrolls they unveil the site. In due course
                  JavaScript will help me make this experience feel exciting and
                  polished. This will transform the mundane act of scrolling
                  down a webpage into an adventure. As the viewer scrolls down
                  the site they become curios to see how things will change and
                  what will come next. While scrolling, I introduce myself and I
                  invite the visitor to look around the site. I don't
                  necessarily expect them to follow my prompts. I just want them
                  to keep scrolling.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Once hey have started so they'll probably continue. I don't
                  expect victors to explore my whole site (even if I would like
                  them to) they'll probably just look at the homepage. Following
                  hyperlinks implies distance and travel. The visitor has so
                  many option to chose from an chose nothing as a result.
                </p>
                <p>
                  But what is the whole site is a homepage? If the about, blogs,
                  game and so on are all on my home page already then the
                  visitor will feel there is more to explore. They won't have
                  got to the bottom and this incompleteness if powerful. When I
                  add JS to the site I will turn the top navigation bar into a
                  progress bar to sell the effect even more.
                </p>
                <p>
                  By the time a visitor scrolls to the bottom they will have
                  seen the overview I wanted to give them.

                  reveal. The nav bar is not the first thing that visitors see.
                  They see 'Hello World'. Screen reader users should be afforded
                  the same experience. A screen reader reads from top to bottom
                  and the page is designed with that in mind. When landing on
                  the index page a screen reader should say “Hello World” and
                  not “navigation, nav-bar”. This concept should be kept in mind
                  throughout the coding of this site.

                  <p>
                    A quick note before we begin. I am a firm believer of the
                    age old writing rule: “show don't tell” (Kinda ironic that
                    I'm telling you this).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I find that claiming to be good at something is about as
                    meaningful as measuring the weigh of a box by looking at it.
                    Terms like 'good'; 'great'; 'excellent' and 'horrible' are
                    all relative. Everyone has their own personal standard and
                    then we get the Dunning-Kruger effect. Sure you can have
                    something measurable like experience of qualification - but
                    that alone doesn't necessarily imply meticulous craft,
                    personal growth and artistic flare.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The best way to convince someone I have the skills they want
                    is to show them what I can do. Fortunately a portfolio is
                    designed to do just that - yay!
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Unfortunate, when designing the portfolio I have to try and
                    emphasise what I am good at and trick people into thinking
                    it. In some cases I might need to claim that I am 'good' at
                    things - without proving anything. I know it can be cringy
                    worthy and I'll be cringing with you. But self-promotion is
                    the aim of this game (actually it's a website) and I'd show
                    myself to be a pretty poor designer if my system didn't do
                    that.

                  <h3 class="dev-h">What am I doing with this website?</h3>
                  <p>
                    It is a portfolio website. So its primary purpose is to sell
                    a product and that product is me.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This website will hold my portfolio as a game designer - but
                    also as a critical and systems thinker. As a designer I tend
                    to focus more on technical implementation and system design
                    than art and animation. The website needs to highlight these
                    strengths and convince the visitor that they need my
                    services.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I am fortunate because the skills I wish to convey are
                    deeply linked to web-development. If this website delivers a
                    smooth system and a good user experience, then the site
                    itself becomes the portfolio.

                    Anyone visiting a portfolio website is aware that the
                    purpose of the site is to impress them. The expect to see me
                    standing in a suit and tie to show them my best-polished
                    brass.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Trying to impress people is not very impressive. I could be
                    a clean cut cooperate coder, but I might also come of as a
                    sleazy snake-oil salesman. One is dubious, and frankly the
                    other is quite boring.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I don't want my website to feel pretentiously professional,
                    nor do I want it to feel like a self-pitch. I want to give
                    it a casual vibe. I want visitors to see that I am
                    passionate about what I am doing and feel that I am sharing
                    that passion with them. I want them to think of this website
                    as a dialog rather than a business pitch, a sharing ideas
                    rather than an exhibition. Hopefully this will feel more
                    genuine and make me seem like a creative and interesting
                    human, rather than just another cut-out candidate.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As an engineer-to be (if all goes according to my current
                    plans) I have a creative edge over most technical graduates.
                    I would have competed several humanities focused courses and
                    engaged more deeply with the artistic and philosophical
                    aspects of technology. Making games provides great incites
                    into UX, UI and human centerer systems. These are useful and
                    transferable skills when it comes to systems design an
                    implantation.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As an artist and designer the convers is true. I would have
                    a professional technical degree.

                    But what sets me apart form other people who have the same
                    qualification as me? My meness. I like to think that I am
                    driven and strive for excellence yet remain playful and love
                    my work. (I do tend to overthinking, I'm a victim to over
                    scoping, perfection paralysis, rambling and going off on
                    tangents from my tangents - but that's me too.) I want the
                    site to reflect that duality. Professional, yet playful.
                    Clear yet creative. (Prone to random tangents and probably
                    quite extra; yet well oiled and reliable when it matters).

                  <p>
                    Simple. The site just needs to reflect everything I just
                    said. And now the question is how.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    P.S. I don't just want the wesite to 'feel' casual, realaxed
                    and honest. Smart people can see throught that. I want it to
                    truly be this way. As much as it IS a portfolio website and
                    its unavoidable primary focus is to showcase my work to
                    potential employers, it can also be a place for me to share
                    my work with colleagues and friends. If I'm honest, I'd love
                    it to be the latter. Giving it elements of the later says
                    more about me than any essey ever could.
